            <p data-verse="33:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O Lord, have mercy on us: for we have waited for thee: be thou our arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> At the voice of the angel the people fled, and at the lifting up thyself the nations are scattered.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts are gathered, as when the ditches are full of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Lord is magnified, for he hath dwelt on high: he hath filled Sion with judgment and justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there shall be faith in thy times: riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold they that see shall cry without, the angels of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The ways are made desolate, no one passeth by the road, the covenant is made void, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not regarded the men.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The land hath mourned, and languished: Libanus is confounded and become foul, and Saron is become as a desert: and Basan and Carmel are shaken.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now will I rise up, saith the Lord: now will I be exalted, now will I lift up myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> You shall conceive heat, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath as fire shall devour you.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the people shall be as ashes after a fire, as a bundle of thorns they shall be burnt with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Hear, you that are far off, what I have done, and you that are near know my strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The sinners in Sion are afraid, trembling hath seized upon the hypocrites. Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that casteth away avarice by oppression, and shaketh his hands from all bribes, that stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his eyes that he may see no evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall be his highness: bread is given him, his waters are sure.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see the land far off.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thy heart shall meditate fear: where is the learned? where is he that pondereth the words of the law? where is the teacher of little ones?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The shameless people thou shalt not see, the people of profound speech: so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of his tongue, in whom there is no wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity: thy eyes shall see Jerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be removed: neither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Because only there our Lord is magnificent: it place of rivers, very broad and spacious streams: no ship with oars shall pass by it, neither shall the great galley pass through it.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king: he will save us.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thy tacklings are loosed, and they shall be of no strength: thy mast shall be in such condition, that thou shalt not be able to spread the flag. Then shall the spoils of much prey be divided: the lame shall take the spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Neither shall he that is near, say: I am feeble. The people that dwell therein, shall have their iniquity taken away from them.</p>

            <p data-verse="33:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>

            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</p>
            <p data-verse="33:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</p>
