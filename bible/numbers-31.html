            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Revenge first the children of Israel on the Madianites, and so thou shalt be gathered to thy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses forthwith said: Arm of you men to fight, who may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel to be sent to the war.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve thousand men well appointed for battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses sent them with Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest, and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when they had fought against the Madianites and had overcome them, they slew all the men.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of Beer they killed with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they took their women, and their children captives, and all their cattle, and all their goods: and all their possessions they plundered:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all their cities, and their villages, and castles, they burned.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they carried away the booty, and all that they had taken both of men and of beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they brought them to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to all the multitude of the children of Israel. But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan over against Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Moses being angry with the chief officers of the army, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Said: Why have you saved the women?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin of Phogor, for which also the people was punished?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the children: and put to death the women, that have carnally known men.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save for yourselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And stay without the camp seven days. He that hath killed a man, or touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third day and the seventh day.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And of all the spoil, every garment, or vessel, or any thing made for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood, shall be purified.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army, that had fought, in this manner: This is the ordinance of the law, which the Lord hath commanded Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lend, and tin,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified by fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified with the water of expiation:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And you shall wash your garments the seventh day, and being purified, you shall afterwards enter into the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Lord said to Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them that fought and went out to the war, and between the rest of the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that fought and were in the battle, one soul of five hundred as well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because they are the firstfruits of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Seventy-two thousand oxen,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Sixty-one thousand asses:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex, that had not known men.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And one half was given to them that had been in the battle, to wit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned six hundred seventy-five sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one asses:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the portion of the Lord, thirty-two souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had separated for them that had been in the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude, that is to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And out of the sixteen thousand persons,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and centurions were come to Moses, they said:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and not so much as one was wanting.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of us could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers kinds,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles, from the tribunes and from the centurions.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of the testimony, for a memorial of the children of Israel before the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And threescore and one thousand asses,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD’S tribute was threescore and one.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute was thirty and two persons.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD’S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And thirty and six thousand beeves,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And sixteen thousand persons;)</p>
            <p data-verse="31:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> ( For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)</p>
            <p data-verse="31:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.</p>
