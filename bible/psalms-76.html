            <p data-verse="76:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:</p>
            <p data-verse="76:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battie.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> All the foolish of heart were troubled. They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,</p>
            <p data-verse="76:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="76:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents. To him that is terrible,</p>
            <p data-verse="76:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth.</p>
