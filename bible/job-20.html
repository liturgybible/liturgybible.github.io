            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind is hurried away to different things.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The doctrine with which thou reprovest me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon the earth,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> that the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If his pride mount up even to heaven, and his head touch the clouds:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and they that has seen him shall say: Where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he shall pass as a vision of the night:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands shall render him his sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For when evil shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in his throat.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps within him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The riches which he hath swallowed; he shall vomit up, and God shall draw them out of his belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper's tongue shall kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> (Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of honey and of butter.)</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall not be consumed: according to the multitude of his devices so also shall he suffer.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Because he broke in and stripped the poor: he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And yet his belly was not filled: and when he hath the things he coveted, he shall not be able to possess them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing shall continue of his goods:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall burn, and every sorrow shall fall upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> May his belly be filled, that God may send forth the wrath of his indignation upon him, and rain down his war upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a bow of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its scabbard, and glittereth in his bitterness: the terrible ones shall go and come upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> All darkness is hid in his secret places: a fire that is not kindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in his tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be pulled down in the day of God's wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his doings from the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</p>
