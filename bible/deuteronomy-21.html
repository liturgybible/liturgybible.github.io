            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thy ancients and judges shall go out, and shall measure from the place where the body lieth the distance of every city round about:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the ancients of that city which they shall perceive to be nearer than the rest, shall take a heifer of the herd, that hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley, that never was ploughed, nor sown: and there they shall strike off the head of the heifer:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come, whom the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in his name, and that by their word every matter should be decided, and whatsoever is clean or unclean should be judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the ancients of that city shall come to the person slain, and shall wash their hands over the heifer that was killed in the valley,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And shall say: Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be merciful to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, and lay not innocent blood to their charge, in the midst of thy people Israel. And the guilt of blood shall be taken from them:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt be free from the innocent's blood, that was shed, when thou shalt have done what the Lord hath commanded thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If thou go out to fight against thy enemies, and the Lord thy God deliver them into thy hand, and thou lead them away captives,</p>

            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And shall put off the raiment, wherein she was taken: and shall remain in thy house, and mourn for her father and mother one month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt sleep with her, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Rut if afterwards she please thee not, thou shalt let her go free, but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by might because thou hast humbled her.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If a man have two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and they have had children by him, and the son of the hated be the firstborn,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he meaneth to divide his substance among his sons: he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn, and prefer him before the son of the hated.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, and shall give him a double portion of all he hath: for this is the first of his children, and to him are due the first birthrights.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If a man have a stubborn and unruly son, who will not hear the commandments of his father or mother, and being corrected, slighteth obedience:</p>

            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And shall say to them: This our son is rebellious and stubborn, he slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself to revelling, and to debauchery and banquetings:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The people of the city shall stone him: and he shall die, that you may take away the evil out of the midst of you, and all Israel hearing it may be afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be punished with death, and being condemned to die is hanged on a gibbet:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> His body shall not remain upon the tree, but shall be buried the same day: for he is accursed of God that hangeth on a tree: and thou shalt not defile thy land, which the Lord thy God shall give thee in possession.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>
