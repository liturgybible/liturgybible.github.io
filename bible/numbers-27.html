            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the son of Hepher, the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and their names are Maala, and Noa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Thersa.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Our father died in the desert, and was not in the sedition, that was raised against the Lord under Core, but he died in his own sin: and he had no male children. Why is his name taken away out of his family, because he had no son? Give us a possession among the kinsmen of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses referred their cause to the judgment of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing : Give them a possession among their father's kindred, and let them succeed him in his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these things:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to his daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If he have no daughter, his brethren shall succeed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And if he have no brethren, you shall give the inheritance to his father's brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But if he have no uncles by the father, the inheritance shall be given to them that are the next akin. And this shall be to the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Lord also said to Moses: Go up into this mountain Abarim, and view from thence the land which I will give to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when thou shalt have seen it, thou also shalt go to thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctify me before them at the waters. These are the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses answered him:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide a man, that may be over this multitude:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And may go out and in before them, and may lead them out, or bring them in: lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Lord said to him: Take Josue the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and all the multitude:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all, and part of thy glory, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If any thing be to be done, Eleazar the priest shall consult the Lord for him. He and all the children of Israel with him, and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his word.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And when he had taken Josue, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and all the assembly of the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And laying his hands on his head, he repeated all things that the Lord had commanded.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>
