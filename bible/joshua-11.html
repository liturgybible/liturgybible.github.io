            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king of Achsaph:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea side :</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To the Chanaanites also on the ease and on the west, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in the mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land of Maspha.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they all came out with their troops, a people exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also and chariots a very great multitude,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And all these kings assembled together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for to morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Josue came, and all the army with him, against them to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon, and the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east side thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed their horses and burned their chariots.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these kingdoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city itself with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the children of Israel divided among themselves all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country, and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings he took, smote and slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Josue made war a long time against these kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There was hot a city that delivered itself to the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took all by fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall, and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> At that time Josue came and cut off the Enacims from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land of the children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and Azotus, in which alone they were left.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to Moses, and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from wars.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</p>
