            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh. My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle; in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity hath lied to itself.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</p>
