            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren: That except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of the other side, should go up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem about this question.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They therefore being brought on their way by the church, passed through Phenice, and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and ancients, declaring how great things God had done with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But there arose some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying: They must be circumcised, and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know, that in former days God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in like manner as they also.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And all the multitude held their peace; and they heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles a people to his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and the ruins thereof I will rebuild, and I will set it up:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For which cause I judge that they, who from among the Gentiles are converted to God, are not to be disquieted.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to choose men of their own company, and to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men, and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you than these necessary things:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch; and gathering together the multitude, delivered the epistle.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, with many words comforted the brethren, and confirmed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by the brethren, unto them that had sent them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there; and Judas alone departed to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas: Let us return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they do.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Barnabas would have taken with them John also, that was surnamed Mark;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Paul desired that he (as having departed from them out of Pamphylia, and not gone with them to the work) might not be received.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And there arose a dissension, so that they departed one from another; and Barnabas indeed taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But Paul choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by the brethren to the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>
