            <p data-verse="64:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee : deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing,</p>
            <p data-verse="64:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> to shoot in secret the undefiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?</p>
            <p data-verse="64:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to a deep heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="64:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> and God shall be exalted. The arrows of children are their wounds:</p>
            <p data-verse="64:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> and their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled;</p>
            <p data-verse="64:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> and every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God: and understood his doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised.</p>

            <p data-verse="64:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="64:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</p>
            <p data-verse="64:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>
            <p data-verse="64:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
