            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's; who will give you that which is your own?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>

            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?</p>

            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</p>
