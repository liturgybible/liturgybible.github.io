            <p data-verse="73:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A psalm for Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!</p>
            <p data-verse="73:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because I had a zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For there is no regard to their death, nor is there strength in their stripes.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like other men. B Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="73:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore will my people return here and full days shall be found in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
            <p data-verse="73:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold these are sinners; and yet abounding in the world they have obtained riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight:</p>
            <p data-verse="73:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up thou hast cast them down.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; so in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed:</p>
            <p data-verse="73:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with thy glory thou hast received me.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="73:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For thee my flesh and my heart hath fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God: That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p>

            <p data-verse="73:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup  are wrung out to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
            <p data-verse="73:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against  the generation of thy children.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</p>
            <p data-verse="73:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="73:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</p>
