            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And entering in, he walked through Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans, and he was rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And calling his ten servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to them: Trade till I come.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high!</p>
            <p data-verse="19:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</p>

            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
