            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>
