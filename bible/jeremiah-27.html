            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, this word came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord to me: Make thee bands, and chains: and thou shalt put them on thy neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt send them to the of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon: by the hand of the messengers that are come to Jerusalem to Sedecias the king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt command them to speak to their masters: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your masters:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I made the earth, and the men, and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power, and by my stretched out arm: and I have given it to whom it seemed good in my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon my servant: moreover also the beasts of the field I have given him to serve him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son: till the time come for his land and himself: and many nations and great kings shall serve him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the nation and kingdom that will not serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and whosoever will not bend his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon: I will visit upon that nation with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, saith the Lord: till I consume them by his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore hearken not to your prophets, and diviners, and dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, that say to you: You shall not serve the king Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they prophesy lies to you: to remove you far from your country, and east you out, and to make you perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the nation that shall bend down their neck under the yoke of the king Babylon, and shall serve him: Will let them remain in their own land, saith the Lord: and they shall till it, and dwell in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I spoke to Sedecias the king of Juda according to all these words, saying: Bend down your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, and his people, and you shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Why will you die, thou and thy people by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Hearken not to the words of the prophets that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they tell you a lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For I have not sent them, saith the Lord: and they prophesy in my name falsely: to drive you out, and that you may perish, both you, and the prophets that prophesy to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I spoke also to the priests, and to this people, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Hearken not to the words of your prophets, that prophesy to you, saying: Behold the vessels of the Lord shall now in a short time be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore hearken not to them, but serve the king of Babylon, that you may live. Why should this city be given up to desolation?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But if they be prophets, and the word of the Lord be in them: let them interpose themselves before the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which were left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda, and in Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts d to the pillars, and to the sea, and to the bases, and to the rest of the vessels that remain in this city:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the great men of Juda and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda and Jerusalem:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day of their visitation, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to be brought, and to be re- stored in this place.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</p>
