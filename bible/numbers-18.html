            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, and the sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready in hand, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands, and about all the works of the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they die, and you also perish with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But let them be with thee, and watch in the charge of the tabernacle, and in all the ceremonies thereof. A stranger shall not join himself with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary, and in the ministry of the altar: lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel, and have delivered them for a gift to the Lord, to serve in the ministries of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood: and all things that pertain to the service of the altar, and that are within the veil, shall be executed by the priests. If any stranger shall approach, he shall be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have given thee the charge of my firstfruits. All things that are sanctified by the children of Israel, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for the priestly office, by everlasting ordinances.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are sanctified, and are offered to the Lord. Every offering, and sacrifice, and whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for trespass, and becometh holy of holies, shall be for thee and thy sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary: the males only shall eat thereof, because it is a consecrated thing to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the firstfruits, which the children of Israel shall vow and offer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters, by a perpetual law. He that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> All the best of the oil, and of the wine, and of the corn, whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I have given them to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> All the firstripe of the fruits, that the ground bringeth forth, and which are brought to the Lord, shall be for thy use: he that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by vow, shall be thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh, which they offer to the Lord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall belong to thee: only for the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price, and every beast that is unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the redemption of it shall be after one month, for five sicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the firstling of a cow and of a sheep and of a goat thou shalt not cause to be redeemed, because they are sanctified to the Lord. Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar, and their fat thou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as the consecrated breast, and the right shoulder shall be thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and to thy sons and daughters, by a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt for ever before the Lord, to thee and to thy sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord said to Aaron: You shall possess nothing in their land, neither shall you have a portion among them: I am thy portion and inheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of Israel for a possession for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the tabernacle of the covenant:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That the children of Israel may not approach any more to the tabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle, and bear the sins of the people. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations. They shall not possess any other thing,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But be content with the oblation or tithes, which I have separated for their uses and necessities.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Command the Levites, and declare unto them: When you shall receive of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have given you, offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to say, the tenth part of the tenth:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of firstfruits, as well of the barnfloors as of the winepresses:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And of all the things of which you receive tithes, offer the firstfruits to the Lord, and give them to Aaron the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> All the things that you shall offer of the tithes, and shall separate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the best and choicest things.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And thou shalt say to them: If you offer all the goodly and the better things of the tithes, it shall be reckoned to you as if you had given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the winepress:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And you shall eat them in all your places, both you and your families: because it is your reward for the ministry, wherewith you serve in the tabernacle of the testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And you shall not sin in this point, by reserving the choicest and fat things to yourselves, lest you profane the oblations of the children of Israel, and die.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest’s office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD’S heave offering to Aaron the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</p>
