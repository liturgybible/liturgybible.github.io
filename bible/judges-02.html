            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weepers, and said: I made you go out of Egypt, and have brought you into the land for which I swore to your fathers: and I promised that I would not make void my covenant with you for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> On condition that you should not make a league with the inhabitants of this land, but should throw down their altars: and you would not hear my voice: why have you done this?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your face: that you may have enemies, and their gods may be your ruin.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, they lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the name of that place was called, The place of weepers, or of tears: and there they offered sacrifices to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Josue sent away the people, and the children of Israel went every one to his own possession to hold it:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they served the Lord all his days, and the days of the ancients, that lived a long time after him, and who knew all the works of the Lord, which he had done for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Josue the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years old,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they buried him in the borders of his possession in Thamnathsare in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaas.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all that generation was gathered to their fathers: and there arose others that knew not the Lord, and the works which he had done for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they served Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they left the Lord the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt: and they followed strange gods, and the gods of the people that dwelt round about them, and they adored them: and they provoked the Lord to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Forsaking him, and serving Baal and Astaroth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord being angry against Israel, delivered them into the hands of plunderers: who took them and sold them to their enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they stand against their enemies:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the Lord was upon them, as he had said, and as he had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord raised up judges, to deliver them from the hands of those that oppressed them: but they would not hearken to them,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Committing fornication with strange gods, and adoring them. They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had walked: and hearing the commandments of the Lord, they did all things contrary.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left, when he died:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</p>
