            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Among brethren he that is chief is honorable; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The fear of the Lord goeth before the obtaining of authority: but roughness and pride is the losing thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The poor man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty?</p>
