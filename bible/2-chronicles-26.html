            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And all the people of Juda took his son Ozias, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of Amasias his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He built Ailath, and restored it to the dominion of Juda, after that the king slept with his fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ozias was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jechelia of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Amasias his father had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias that understood and saw God: and as long as he sought the Lord, he directed him in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Moreover he went forth and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Geth, and the wall of Jabnia, and the wall of Azotus: and he built towns in Azotus, and among the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the ammonites gave gifts to Ozias: and his name was spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt for his frequent victories.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem over the gate of the corner, and over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same side of the wall, and fortified them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns, for he had much cattle both in the plains, and in the waste of the desert: he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was a man that loved husbandry.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the army of his fighting men, that went out to war, was under the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor, end under the hand of Henanias, who was one of the king's captains.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the whole number of the chiefs by the families of valiant men were two thousand six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the whole army under them three hundred and seven thousand five hundred: who were fit for war, and fought for the king against the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Ozias prepared for them, that is, for the whole army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and slings to cast stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he made in Jerusalem engines of diverse kinds, which he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows, and great stones: and his name went forth far abroad, for the Lord helped him, and had strengthened him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But when he was made strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction, and he neglected the Lord his God: and going into the temple of the Lord, he had a mind to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And immediately Azarias the priest going in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, most valiant men,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Withstood the king and said: It doth not belong to thee, Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but to the priests, that is, to the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated for this ministry: go out of the sanctuary, do not despise: for this thing shall not be accounted to thy glory by the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Ozias was angry, and holding in his hand the censer to burn incense, threatened the priests. And presently there rose a leprosy in his forehead before the priests, in the house of the Lord at the altar of incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Azarias the high priest, and all the rest of the priests looked upon him, and saw the leprosy in his forehead, and they made haste to thrust him out. Yea himself also being frightened, hasted to go out, because he had quickly felt the stroke of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and he dwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy, for which he had been cast out of the house of the Lord. And Joatham his son governed the king's house, and judged the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the rest of the acts of Ozias first and last were written by Isaias the son of Amos, the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchres, because he was a leper: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>
