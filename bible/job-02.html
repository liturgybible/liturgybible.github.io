            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came among them, and stood in his sight,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man simple, and upright, and fearing Cod, and avoiding evil, and still keeping his innocence ? But thou hast moved me against him, that I sho uld afflict him without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin, and all that a man hath he will give for his life:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> gut put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, and then thou shalt gee that he will bless thee to thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said to Satan: Behold be is in thy hand, but yet save his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So Satan went forth from the presence Of the Lord, and struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot even to the top of his head:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter, sitting on a dunghill.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity? bless God and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to her: Thou hast; spoken like one of the foolish women: if we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Alphas the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, a nd comfort him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out they wept, and rending their garments they sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>
