            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It seemed good to Darius, and he appointed over the kingdom a hundred and twenty governors to be over his whole kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And three princes over them, of whom Daniel was one: that the governors might give an account to them, and the king might have no trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Daniel excelled all the princes, and governors: because a greater spirit of God was in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom: whereupon the princes, and the governors sought to find occasion against Daniel with regard to the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault, nor suspicion was found in him</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then these men said: We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless perhaps concerning the law of his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the princes, and the governors craftily suggested to the king, and spoke thus unto him: King Darius, live for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governors, the senators, and judges have consulted together, that an imperial decree, and an edict be published: That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god, or man, for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now, therefore, O king, confirm the sentence, and sign the decree: that what is decreed by the Medes and Persians may not be altered, nor any man be allowed to transgress it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So king Darius set forth the decree, and established it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now when Daniel knew this, that is to say, that the law was made, he went into his house: and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem, he knelt down three times a day, and adored, and gave thanks before his God, as he had been accustomed to do before.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore those men carefully watching him, found Daniel praying and making supplication to his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every man that should make a request to any of the gods, or men, for thirty days, but to thyself, O king, should be cast into the den of the lions? And the king answered them, saying: The word is true according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not lawful to violate.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him and even till sunset he laboured to save him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But those mer. perceiving the king's design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the king went away to his house and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then the king rising very early in the morning, went in haste to the lions' den:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And coming near to the den, cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel, and said to him: Daniel, servant of the living God, hath thy God, whom thou servest always, been able, thinkest thou, to deliver thee from the lions?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut up the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him justice hath been found in me: yea and before thee, O king, I have done no offence.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that bad accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: PEACE be multiplied unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> It is decreed by me, that in all my empire and my kingdom all men dread and fear the God of Daniel. For he is the living and eternal God for ever: and his kingdom shall not be destroyed, and his power shall be for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He is the deliverer, and saviour, doing signs and wonders in heaven, and in earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now Daniel continued unto the reign of Darius, and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>
