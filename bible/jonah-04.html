            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, is not this what I said, when I was yet in my own country? therefore I went before to flee into Tharsis: for I know that thou art a gracious and merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me: for it is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Lord said: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of the city: and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would befall the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was fatigued): and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the following day: and it struck the ivy and it withered.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning wind: and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the heat: and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said: It is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord said to Jonas: Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry, for the ivy? And he said: I am angry with reason even unto death.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord said: Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou hast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and in one night perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And shall not I spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that know not how to distinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</p>
