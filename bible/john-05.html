            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And you will not come to me that you may have life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> I receive glory not from men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> I receive not honour from men.</p>
