            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they understood not, that he called God his Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> When he spoke these things, many believed in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> But if I say the truth, you believe me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</p>
