            <p data-verse="50:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Because I came, and there was not a man: I called, and there was none that would hear. Is my hand shortened and become little, that I cannot redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold at my rebuke I will make the sea a desert, I will turn the rivers into dry land: the fishes shall rot for want of water, and shall die for thirst.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their covering.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakeneth in the morning, in the morning he wakeneth my ear, that I may hear him as a master.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not resist: I have not gone back.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I have given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to them that plucked them: I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me, and spit upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The Lord God is my helper, therefore am I not confounded: therefore have I set my face as a most hard rock, and I know that I shall not be confounded.</p>

Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.</p>
