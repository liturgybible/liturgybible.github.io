            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.</p>
