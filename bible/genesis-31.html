            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But after that he heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's, and being enriched by his substance is become great:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And perceiving also that Laban's countenance was not towards him as yesterday and the other day,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Especially the Lord saying to him: Return into the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field, where he fed the flocks,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And said to them: I see your father's countenance is not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of my father hath been with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And you know that I have served your father to the utmost of my power.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Yea, your father also hath overreached me, and hath changes my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him to hurt me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If at any time he said: The speckled shall be thy wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white ones for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God hath taken your father's substance, and given it to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For after that time came of the ewes conceiving, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep that the males which leaped upon the females were of diverse colors, and spotted, and speckled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob? And I answered: Here I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the males leaping upon the females, are of divers colors, spotted, and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of this land, and return into thy native country.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we anything left among the goods and inheritance of our father's house?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hath he not counted us as strangers and sold us, and eaten up the price of us?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered them to us, and to our children: wherefore do all that God hath commanded thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and wives upon camels, went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he took all his substance, and flocks, and whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to Isaac his father to the land of Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole away her father's idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jacob would not confess to his father in law that he was flying away.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when he was gone, together with all that belonged to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount Galaad,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he saw in a dream God saying to him: Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he with his brethren had overtaken him, he pitched his tent in the same mount of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters, as captives taken with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Why wouldst thou run away privately and not acquaint me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters: thou hast done foolishly: and now, indeed,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> It is in my power to return thee evil: but the God of your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any things harshly against Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But whereas thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was entered into Rachel's tent,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> She in haste hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee, because it has now happened to me, according to the custom of women, So his careful search was in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of mine, and for what offense on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Have I therefore been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did not eat:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Neither did I show thee that which the beast had torn, I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft, thou didst exact it of me:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Day and night was I parched with heat, and with frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Unless the God of my father Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesterday.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Laban answered him: The daughters are mine and the children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are mine: what can I do to my children, and grandchildren?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Come therefore, let us enter into a league: that it may be for a testimony between me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And they gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Laban called it The witness heap: and Jacob, The hillock of testimony: each of them according to the propriety of his language.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called Galaad, that is, The witness heap.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> The Lord behold and judge between us when we shall be gone one from the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God, who is present and beholdeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And he said again to Jacob: Behold, this heap, and the stone which I have set up between me and thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone, be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it, thinking harm to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of their father, judge between us. And jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain, he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten, they lodged there:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> But laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons, and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his place.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</p>
