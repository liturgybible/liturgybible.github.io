            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the men of Ephraim said to him: What is this that thou meanest to do, that thou wouldst not call us when thou wentest to fight against Madian? and they chid him sharply and almost offered violence.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he answered them: What could I have done like to that which you have done? Is not one bunch of grapes of Ephraim better than the vintages of Abiezer?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord hath delivered into your bands the princes of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: what could I have done like to what you have done? And when he had said this, their spirit was appeased, with which they swelled against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan, he passed over it with the three hundred men, that were with him: who were so weary that they could not pursue after them that fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said to the men of Soccoth: Give, I beseech you, bread to the people that is with me, for they are faint: that we may pursue Zebee, and Salmana the kings of Madian.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The princes of Soccoth answered: Peradventure the palms of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to thy army.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to them: When the Lord therefore shall have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh your flesh with the thorns and briers of the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And going up from thence, he came to Phanuel: and he spoke the like things to the men of that place. And they also answered him, as the men of Soccoth had answered.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He said therefore to them also: When I shall return a conqueror in peace, I will destroy this tower.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army. For fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of the eastern people, and one hundred and twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword, were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the east of Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were secure, and suspected no hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and took them, all their host being put in confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And returning from the battle before the sun rising,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He took a boy of the men of Soccoth: and he asked him the names of the princes and ancients of Soccoth, and he described unto him seventy-seven men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he came to Soccoth and said to them: Behold Zebee and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying: Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana, are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the men that are weary and faint.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So he took the ancients of the city and thorns and briers of the desert, and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the men of Soccoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said to Zebee and Salmana: What manner of men were they whom you slew in Thabor? They answered: They were like thee, and one of them as the son of a king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He answered them: They were my brethren, the sons of my mother. As the Lord liveth, if you had saved them, I would not kill you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said to Jether his eldest son: Arise, and slay them. But he drew not his sword: for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Zebee and Salmana said: Do thou rise, and run upon us: because the strength of a man is according to his age: Gedeon rose up and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the ornaments and bosses, with which the necks of the camels of kings are wont to be adorned.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon: Rule thou over us and thy son, and thy son's son: because thou hast delivered us from the hand of Madian.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said to them: I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, but the Lord shall rule over you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said to them: I desire one request of you: Give me the earlets of your spoils. For the Ismaelites were accustomed to wear golden earlets.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> They answered: We will give them most willingly. And spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the weight of the earlets that he requested, was a thousand seven hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornaments, and jewels, and purple raiment which the kings of Madian were went to use, and besides the golden chains that were about the camels' necks.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city Ephra. And all Israel committed fornication with it, and it became a ruin to Gedeon and to all his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But Madian was humbled before the children of Israel, neither could they any more lift up their beads: but the land rested for forty years, while Gedeon presided.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So Jerobaal the son of Joas went, and dwelt in his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh, for he had many wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Gedeon the son of Joas died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father in Ephra of the family of Ezri.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and committed fornication with Baalim. And they made a covenant with Baal, that he should be their god:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round about:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal Gedeon, according to all the good things he had done to Israel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’ necks.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.</p>
