            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not; behold the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures, and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the living creatures, and the ancients; and the number of them was thousands of thousands,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces, and adored him that liveth for ever and ever.</p>
