            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and ceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all times.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Know this day the things that your children know not, who saw not the chastisements of the Lord your God. his great doings and strong hand, and stretched out arm,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king Pharao, and to all his land,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses and chariots: how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they pursued you, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And what he hath done to you in the wilderness, till you came to this place:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Ruben: whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with their households and tents, and all their substance, which they had in the midst of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Your eyes have seen all the greet works of the Lord, that he hath done,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this day, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are entering,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And may live in it a long time: which the Lord promised by oath to your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like the land of Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the seed is sown, waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But it is a land of hills and plains, expecting rain from heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day, that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that you may eat and be filled.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you depart from the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain come not down, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish quickly from the excellent land, which the Lord will give you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Lay up these my words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a sign on your hands, and place them between your eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, end when thou liest down and risest up.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy children in the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers, that he would give them as long as the heaven hangeth over the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and do them, to love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, cleaving unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Lord will destroy all these nations before your face, and you shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Every place, that your foot shall tread upon, shall be yours. From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto the western sea shall be your borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> None shall stand against you: the Lord your God shall lay the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as he hath spoken to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a curse:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> A curse, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your. God, but revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk after strange gods which you know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, whither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Garizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to the setting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the plain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley that reacheth and entereth far.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For you shall pass over the Jordan, to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and possess it.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And then the LORD’S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.</p>
