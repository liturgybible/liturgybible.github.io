            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Jethro the priest of Madian, the kinsman of Moses, had heard all the things that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He took Sephora the wife of Moses whom he had sent back:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam, his father saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the other Eliezer: For the God of my father, said he, is my helper, and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jethro the kinsman of Moses came with his sons and his wife, to Moses into the desert, where he was camped by the mountain of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he sent word to Moses, saying: I Jethro thy kinsman come to thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped and kissed him: and they saluted one another with words of peace. And when he was come into the tent,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharao, and the Egyptians, in favour of Israel: and all the labour which had befallen them in the journey, and that the Lord had delivered them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had done to Israel, because he had delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said: Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of Pharao, and out of the hand of the Egyptians, who hath delivered his people out of the hand of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now I know that the Lord is great above all gods: because they dealt proudly against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So Jethro the kinsman of Moses offered holocausts and sacrifices to God: and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel came, to eat bread with them before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the next day Moses sat, to judge the people, who stood by Moses from morning until night.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people, he said: What is it that thou dost among the people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to judge between them, and to shew the precepts of God, and his laws.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he said: The thing thou dost is not good.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and this people that is with thee: the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee. Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to God, to bring their words to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And to shew the people the ceremonies and the manner of worshipping, and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that they ought to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, in whom there is truth, and that hate avarice, and appoint of them rulers of thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who may judge the people at all times: and when any great matter soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be lighter for thee, the burden being shared out unto others.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God, and shalt be able to bear his precepts: and all this people shall return to their places with peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he had suggested unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And choosing able men out of all Israel, he appointed them rulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they judged the people at all times: and whatsoever was of greater difficulty they referred to him, and they judged the easier cases only.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he let his kinsman depart: and he returned and went into his own country.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p>
