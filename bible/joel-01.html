            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take delight in drinking sweet wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number: his teeth are like the teeth of a lion: and his cheek teeth as of a lion's whelp.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> To thee, 0 Lord, will I cry: because fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness, and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yea and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a garden bed that thirsteth after rain, for the springs of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness.</p>
