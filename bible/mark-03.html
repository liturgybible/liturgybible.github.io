            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And to Simon he gave the name Peter:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his mother and his bretheren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</p>
