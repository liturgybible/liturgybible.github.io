            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honour- able than himself. And have no fellow- ship with one that is richer than thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged and must hold his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If thou give, he will make use of thee: and if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou have any thing, he will live with thee, and will make thee bare, and he will not be sorry for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If he have need of thee he will deceive thee, and smiling upon thee will put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and will say: What wantest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he will shame thee by his meats, till he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at last he will laugh at thee: and afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Humble thyself to God, and wait for his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Beware that thou be not deceived Into folly, and be humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will invite thee the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him, lest thou be forgotten.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Affect not to speak with him as an equal: and believe not his many words: for by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy secrets.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt, and to cast thee into prison.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Love God all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Every beast loveth its like: so also every man him that is nearest to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> All flesh shall consort with the like to itself, and every man shall associate himself to his like.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb, so the sinner with the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The wild ass is the lion's prey in the desert: so also the poor are devoured by the rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And as humility is an abomination to the proud: so also the rich man abhorreth the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When a rich man is shaken, he is kept up by his friends: but when a poor man is fallen down, he is thrust away even by his acquaintance.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers: he hath spoken proud things, and they have justified him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The poor man was deceived, and he is rebuked also: he hath spoken wisely, and could have no place.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The rich man spoke, and all held their peace, and what he said they extol even to the clouds.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The poor man spoke, and they say: Who is this? and if he stumble, they will overthrow him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience: and poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The heart of a man changeth his countenance, either for good, or for evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The token of a good heart, and a good countenance thou shalt hardly find, and with labour.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath scattered us.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children’s works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy, and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives, and love in thee for ever those that are miserable.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise thee with great joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Cursed are all they which hate thee, and blessed shall all be which love thee for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> O blessed are they which love thee, for they shall rejoice in thy peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all thy scourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they have seen all thy glory, and shall be glad for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let my soul bless God the great King.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it for ever.</p>
