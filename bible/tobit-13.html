            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it: and he that hath fellowship with the proud, shall put on pride.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He shall take a burden upon him that hath fellowship with one more honour- able than himself. And have no fellow- ship with one that is richer than thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? for if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged and must hold his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If thou give, he will make use of thee: and if thou have nothing, he will forsake thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou have any thing, he will live with thee, and will make thee bare, and he will not be sorry for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If he have need of thee he will deceive thee, and smiling upon thee will put thee in hope; he will speak thee fair, and will say: What wantest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he will shame thee by his meats, till he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at last he will laugh at thee: and afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Humble thyself to God, and wait for his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Beware that thou be not deceived Into folly, and be humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will invite thee the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him, lest thou be forgotten.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Affect not to speak with him as an equal: and believe not his many words: for by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy secrets.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt, and to cast thee into prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to what thou hearest: for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When thou hearest those things, see as it were in sleep, and thou shalt awake.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Love God all thy life, and call upon him for thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Every beast loveth its like: so also every man him that is nearest to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> All flesh shall consort with the like to itself, and every man shall associate himself to his like.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb, so the sinner with the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The wild ass is the lion's prey in the desert: so also the poor are devoured by the rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And as humility is an abomination to the proud: so also the rich man abhorreth the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When a rich man is shaken, he is kept up by his friends: but when a poor man is fallen down, he is thrust away even by his acquaintance.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers: he hath spoken proud things, and they have justified him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The poor man was deceived, and he is rebuked also: he hath spoken wisely, and could have no place.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The rich man spoke, and all held their peace, and what he said they extol even to the clouds.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The poor man spoke, and they say: Who is this? and if he stumble, they will overthrow him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Riches are good to him that hath no sin in his conscience: and poverty is very wicked in the mouth of the ungodly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The heart of a man changeth his countenance, either for good, or for evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The token of a good heart, and a good countenance thou shalt hardly find, and with labour.</p>
