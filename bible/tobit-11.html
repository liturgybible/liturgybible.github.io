            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The wisdom of the humble shall exalt his head, and shall make him sit in the midst of great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Praise not a man for his beauty, neither despise a man for his look.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The bee is small among flying things, but her fruit hath the chiefest sweetness.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, end hidden.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Many mighty men have been greatly brought down, and the glorious have been delivered into the hand of others.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast inquired, reprove justly.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Before thou hear, answer not a word: and interrupt not others in the midst of their discourse.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee, and sit not in judgment with sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> My son, meddle not with many matters: and if thou be rich, thou shalt not be free from sin: for if thou pursue after thou shalt not overtake: and if thou run before thou shalt not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is an ungodly man that laboureth, and maketh haste, and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Again, there is an inactive man that wanteth help, is very weak in ability, and full of poverty:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head: and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and this is the portion of his reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward every one according to his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by his children.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh on the fall of his neighbour.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on the elect he will lay a blot.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man, for he worketh evils: lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Receive a stranger in, and he shall overthrow thee with a whirlwind, and shall turn thee out of thy own.</p>
