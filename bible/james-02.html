            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
