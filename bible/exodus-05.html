            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharao: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous: you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you give them rest from their works?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters of the people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before: but let them go and gather straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof: for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you no straw:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Go, and gather it where you can find it: neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfill your work every day as before you were wont to do when straw was given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they that were over the works of the children of Israel were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and to day as before?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword to kill us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</p>
