            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
