            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Maketh his round by the south, and turneth again to the north: the spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about, and returneth to his circuits.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow: unto the place from whence the rivers come, they return, to flow again.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold this is new: for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is no remembrance of former things: nor indeed of those things which hereafter are to come, shall there be any remembrance with them that shall be in the latter end.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the children of men, to be exercised therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have spoken in my heart, saying: Behold I am become great, and have gone beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated many things wisely, and I have learned.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I have given my heart to know prudence, and learning, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation of spirit,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Because In much wisdom there is much indignation: and he that addeth knowledge, addeth also labour.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
