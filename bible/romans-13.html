            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</p>
