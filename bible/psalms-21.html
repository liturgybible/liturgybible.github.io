            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou hast given him his heart's desire: end hast not withholden from him the will of his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He asked life of thee: and thou hast given him length of days for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> His glory is great in thy salvation: glory and great beauty shalt thou lay upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the king hopeth in the Lord: and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies: let thy right hand find out all them that hate thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy anger: the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth: and their seed from among the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For they have intended evils against thee: they have devised counsels which they have not been able to establish.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For thou shalt make them turn their back: in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their face.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>
