            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say: Thus saith the Lord God: A large eagle with great wings, long-limbed, full of feathers, and of variety, came to Libanus, and took away the marrow of the cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof: and carried it away into the land of Chanaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for seed, that it might take a firm root over many waters: he planted it on the surface of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him: and the roots thereof were under him. So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Say thou: Thus saith the Lord God: Shall it prosper then? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither: and this without a strong arm, or many people, to pluck it up by the root?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Behold, it is planted: shall it prosper then? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither in the furrows where it grew?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Say to the provoking house: Know you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof, and carry them with him to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an oath of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty men of the land,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant, and observe it.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As I live, saith the Lord God: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For he had despised the oath, breaking his covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As I live, I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scattered into every wind: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith the Lord God: I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches, and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish. I the Lord have spoken and have done it.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.</p>
