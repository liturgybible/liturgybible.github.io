            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Are you then men alone, and shall wisdom die with you?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I also have a heart as well as you: for who is ignorant of these things, which you know?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He that is mocked by his friends as I, shall call upon God and he will hear him: for the simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The lamp despised in the thoughts of the rich, is ready for the time appointed.</p>
