            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to you, apostate children, saith the Lord, that you would take counsel, and not of me: and would begin a web, and not by my spirit, that you might add sin upon sill:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth, hoping for help in the strength of Pharao, and trusting in the shadow of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the- strength of Pharao shall be to your confusion, and the confidence of the shadow of Egypt to your shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thy princes were in Tanis, and thy messengers came even to Hanes.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They were all confounded at a people that could not profit them: they were no help, nor to any profit, but to confusion and to reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The burden of the beasts of the south. In a land of trouble and distress, from whence come the lioness, and the lion, the viper and the flying basilisk, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of beasts, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not be able to profit them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this: It is pride only, sit still.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now therefore go in and write for them upon box, and note it diligently in a book, and it shall be in the latter days for a testimony for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For it is a people that provoketh to wrath, and lying children, children that will not hear the law of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who say to the seers: See not: and to them that behold: Behold not for us those things that are right: speak unto us pleasant things, see errors for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Take away from me the way, turn away the path from me, let the Holy One of Israel cease from before us.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because you have rejected this word, and have trusted in oppression and tumult, and have leaned upon it:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a breach that falleth, and is found wanting in a high wall, for the destruction thereof shall come on a sudden, when it is not looked for.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it shall be broken small, as the potter's vessel is broken all to pieces with mighty breaking, and there shall not a sherd be found of the pieces thereof, wherein a little fire may be carried from the hearth, or a, little water be drawn out of the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel: If you return and be quiet, you shall be saved: in silence and in hope shall your strength be. And you would not:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But have said: No, but we will flee to horses: therefore shall you flee. And we will mount upon swift ones: therefore shall they be swifter that shall pursue after you.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A thousand men shall flee for fear of one: and for fear of five shall you flee, till you be left as the mast of a ship on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign upon a hill.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore the Lord waiteth that be may have mercy on you: and therefore shall he be exalted sparing you: because the Lord is the God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the people of Sion shall dwell in Jerusalem: weeping thou shalt not weep, he will surely have pity on thee: at the voice of thy cry, se soon as he shell hear, he will answer thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord will give you spare bread, and short water: and will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thy eyes shall see thy teacher.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it: and go not aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And thou shalt defile the plates of thy graven things of silver, and the garment of thy molten things of gold, and shalt cast them away as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. Thou shalt say to it: Get thee hence.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And rain shall be given to thy seed, wheresoever thou shalt sow in the land: and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful, and fat. The lamb in that day shall feed at large in thy possession:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And thy oxen, and the ass colts that till the ground, shall eat mingled pro vender as it was winnowed in the floor.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every elevated hill rivers of running waters in the day of the slaughter of many, when the tower shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the light of the moon shall be se the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days: in the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his people, and shall heal the stroke of their wound.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath burneth, and is heavy to bear: his lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of the neck, to destroy the nations unto nothing, and the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified solemnity, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be heard, and shall shew the terror of his arm, in the threatening of wrath, and the dame of devouring fire: he shall crush to pieces with whirlwind, and hailstones.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For at the voice of the Lord the Assyrian shall fear being struck with the rod.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the passage of the rod shall be strongly grounded, which the Lord shall make to rest upon him with timbrels and harps, and in great battles he shall over throw them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For Topheth is prepared from yesterday, prepared by the king, deep, and wide. The nourishment thereof is fire and much wood: the breath of the Lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling it.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.</p>
