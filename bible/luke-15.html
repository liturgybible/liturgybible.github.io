            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he spoke to them this parable, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said: A certain man had two sons:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</p>
