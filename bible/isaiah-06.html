            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they hew.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</p>
