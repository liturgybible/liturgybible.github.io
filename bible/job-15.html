            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and fill his stomach with burning heat?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou speakest that which is not good for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken away prayers from before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thy iniquity hath taught thy mouth, and thou imitatest the tongue of blasphemers.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thy own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I: and thy own lips shall answer thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Art thou the first man that was born, or wast thou made before the hills ?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Hast thou heard God's counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What knowest thou that we are ignorant of? what dost thou understand that we know not?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> There are with us also aged and ancient men, much elder than thy fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee? but thy wicked words hinder this.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Why doth thy heart elevate thee, and why dost thou stare with thy eyes, as if they were thinking great things ?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Why doth thy spirit swell against God, to utter such words out of thy mouth ?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold among his saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in his sight.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger hath passed among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The wicked man is proud all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The sound of dread is always in his ears: and when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light, looking round about for the sword on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When he moveth himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him, as a king that is prepared for the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath strengthened himself against the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He hath run against him with his neck raised up, and is armed with a fat neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Fatness hath covered his face, and the fat hangeth down on his sides.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in desert houses that are reduced into heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he push his root in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his branches, and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own month.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He shall not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he may be redeemed with any price.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Before his days be full he shall perish: and his hands shall wither away.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first flower, and as an olive tree that casteth its flower.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For the congregation of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shall devour their tabernacles, who love to take bribes.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He hath conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepareth deceits.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
