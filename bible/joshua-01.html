            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> From the desert and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites unto the great sea toward the going; down of the sun, shall be your border.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Behold I command thee, take courage, end be strong. Fear not and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Prepare you victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Your wives, and children, and cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Until the Lord give rest to your brethren as he hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us we will do; and whithersoever thou shalt send us, we will go.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p>
