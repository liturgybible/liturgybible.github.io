            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock of Chanaan:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria, to the house of Bathuel thy mother's father, and take thee a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy uncle.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And God almighty bless thee, and make thee to increase, and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And give the blessings of Abrabam to thee, and to thy seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy sojournment, which he promised to thy grandfather.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Isaac had sent him away, he took his journey and went to Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban the son of Bathuel the Syrian, brother to Rebecca his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob, and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife thence; and that after the blessing he had charged him, saying: Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Chanaan:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And that Jacob obeying his parents was gone into Syria:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Experiencing also that his father was not well pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides them he had before, Maheleth the daughter of Ismael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nabajoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to Haran.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he was come to a certain place, and would rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there, and putting under his head, slept in the same place.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of God ascending and descending by it;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord leaning upon the ladder, saying to him: I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and IN THEE and thy seed all the tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee back into this land: neither will I leave thee, till I shall have accomplished all that I have said.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And trembling he said: How terrible is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jacob, arising in the morning, took the stone, which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title, pouring oil upon the top of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he called the name of the city Bethel, which before was called Luza.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he made a vow, saying: If God shall be with me, and shall keep me in the way by which I walk, and shall give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I shall return prosperously to my father's house: the Lord shall be my God:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And this stone, which I have set up for a title, shall called the house of God: and of all things that thou shalt give to me, I will offer tithes to thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</p>
