            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels: Go, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men, who had the character of the beast; and upon them that adored the image thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and there came blood as it were of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the fountains of waters; and there was made blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art just, O Lord, who art, and who wast, the Holy One, because thou hast judged these things:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun, and it was given unto him to afflict men with heat and fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues, neither did they penance to give him glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom became dark, and they gnawed their tongues for pain:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and wounds, and did not penance for their works.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates; and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For they are the spirits of devils working signs, and they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to battle against the great day of the Almighty God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he shall gather them together into a place, which in Hebrew is called Armagedon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air, and there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It is done.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great.</p>
