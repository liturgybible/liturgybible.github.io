            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</p>

            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</p>
