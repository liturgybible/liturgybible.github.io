            <p data-verse="48:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved:</p>
            <p data-verse="48:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> trembling took hold of them. There were pains as of a woman in labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> With a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="48:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell ye in her towers.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, that ye may relate it in another generation.</p>
