            <p data-verse="57:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let peace come, let him rest in his bed that hath walked in his uprightness.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But draw near hither, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer, and of the harlot.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Upon whom have you jested? upon whom have you opened your mouth wide, and put out your tongue? are not you wicked children, a false seed,</p>
            <p data-verse="57:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree, sacrificing children in the torrents, under the high rocks?</p>
            <p data-verse="57:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the parts of the torrent is thy portion, this is thy lot: and thou hast poured out libations to them, thou hast offered sacrifice. Shall I not be angry at these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="57:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed, and hast gone up thither to offer victims.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And behind the door, and behind the post thou best set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment, and hast multiplied thy perfumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far off, and wast debased even to hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet thou saidst not: I will rest: thou hast found life of thy hand, therefore thou hast not asked.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou hast forgotten me.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not profit thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away, but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and shall possess my holy mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will say: Make a way: give free passage, turn out of the path, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, end breathings I will make.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went away wandering in his own heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back, and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest, and the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="57:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?</p>
            <p data-verse="57:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</p>
            <p data-verse="57:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="57:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p>
