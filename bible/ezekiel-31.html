            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his people: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The waters nourished him, the deep set him up on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country: and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root was near great waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The cedars in the paradise of God wars not higher than he, the fir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, envied him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because he was exalted in height, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted up in his height:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations, he shall deal with him: I have cast him out according to his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And strangers, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country: and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and leave him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height: nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height: for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down into the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the deep: and I withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: Libanus grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are slain by the sword: and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth: thou shalt sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword: this is Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
