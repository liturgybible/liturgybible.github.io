            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay thou here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel. And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come down to Bethel,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The sons of the prophets, that were at Bethel, came forth to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he answered: I also know it: hold your peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Elias said to Eliseus: Stay here because the Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And when they were come to Jericho,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The sons of the prophets that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus, and said to him: Dost thou know that this day the Lord will take away thy master from thee? And he said: I also know it: hold your peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Elias said to him: Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as far as the Jordan. And he said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee; and they two went on together,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets followed them, and stood in sight at a distance: but they two stood by the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Elias took his mantle and folded it together, and struck the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed over on dry ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Eliseus said: I beseech thee that in me may be thy double spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast asked: but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold a fiery chariot, and fiery horses parted them both asunder: and Elias went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the driver thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him: and going back, he stood upon the bank of the Jordan,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had fallen from him, and they were not divided. And he said: Where is now the God of Elias? And he struck the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither, and Eliseus passed over.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. And coming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said: Do not send.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty men: and they sought three days but found him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they came back to him: for he abode at Jericho, and he said to them: Did I not say to you: Do not send?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the men of the city said to Eliseus: Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. And when they had brought it,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he went up from thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they bring it to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>
