            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain: upon which there was as the building of a city, bending towards the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he brought me in thither, and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand, and he stood in the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And this man said to me: Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee: for thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee: declare all that thou seest, to the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth: and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and the height one reed.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went up the steps thereof: and he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate one reed, that is, one threshold was one reed broad:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad: and between the little chambers were five cubits:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within, was one reed.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he measured the porch of the gate eight cubits, and the front thereof two cubits: and the porch of the gate was inward.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the little chambers of the gate that looked eastward were three on this side, and three on that side: all three were of one measure, and the fronts of one measure, on both parts.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate ten cubits: and the length of the gate thirteen cubits:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the border before the little chambers one cubit: and one cubit was the border on both sides: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side and that side.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another, in breadth five and twenty cubits: door against door.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He made also fronts of sixty cubits: and to the front the court of the gate on every side round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And before the face of the gate which reached even to the face of the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate of the north, and that of the ease: and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he brought me out to the way of the south, and behold the gate that looked to the south : and he measured the front thereof, and the porch thereof according to the former measures.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the windows thereof, and the porches round about, as the other windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And there were seven steps to go up to it: and a porch before the doors thereof: and there were graven palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side in the front thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there was a gate of the inner court towards the south: and he measured from gate to gate towards the south, a hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he brought me into the inner court at the south gate : and he measured the gate according to the former measures.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates: there they washed the holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side: that the holocaust, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering might be slain thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And on the outward side, which goeth up to the entry of the gate that looketh toward the north, were two tables. and at the other side before the porch of the gate were two tables.</p>
