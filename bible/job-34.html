            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Eliu continued his discourse, and said :</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me :</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For Job hath said : I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent without any sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he hath said : Man shall not please God, although he run with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me : far from god be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who calleth rulers ungodly?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man : for all are the work of his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways :</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know any thing better, speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
