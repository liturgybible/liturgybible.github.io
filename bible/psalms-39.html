            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I said: I will take heed to my ways : that I sin not with my tongue. I have set guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things : and my sorrow was renewed.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My heart grew hot within me : and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I spoke with my tongue : O Lord, make me know my end. And what is the number of my days : that I may know what is wanting to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold thou hast made my days measurable : and my substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are vanity : every man living.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Surely man passeth as an image : yea, and he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up : and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my substance is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Deliver thou me from all my iniquities : thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> thou hast corrected man for iniquity. And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider : surely in vain is any man disquieted.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication : give ear to my tears. Be not silent : for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be no more.</p>
