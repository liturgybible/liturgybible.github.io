            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men rose up and stood.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and the fatherless that had no helper.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I took away the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>
