            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When thou shalt pass through the waters, I will be with thee, and the rivers shall not cover thee: when thou shalt walk in the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, and the flames shall not burn in thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I have given Egypt for thy atonement, Ethiopia and Saba for thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Fear not, for I am with thee: I will. bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I will say to the north: Give up: and to the south: Keep not back: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And every one that calleth upon my name, I have created him for my glory, I have formed him, and made him.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All the nations are assembled together, and the tribes are gathered: who among you can declare this, and shall make us hear the former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, let them be justified, and hear, and say: It is truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know, and believe me, and understand that I myself am. Before me there was no God formed, and after me there shall be none.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thou hast not offered me the ram of thy holocaust, nor hast thou glorified me with thy victims: I have not caused thee to serve with oblations, nor wearied thee with incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy victims. But thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy iniquities.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I am, I am he that blot out thy iniquities for my own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Put me in remembrance, and let us plead together: tell if thou hast any thing to justify thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Thy brat father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p>
