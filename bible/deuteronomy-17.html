            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So as to go and serve strange gods, and adore them, the sun and the moon. and all the host of heaven, which I have not commanded:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And this is told thee, and hearing it thou hast inquired diligently, and found it to be true, and that the abomination is committed in Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman, who have committed that most wicked thing, to the gates of thy city, and they shall be stoned.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful matter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and cause, leprosy and leprosy: and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates do vary: arise, and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to the judge, that shall be at that time: and thou shalt ask of them, and they shall shew thee the truth of the judgment.</p>
