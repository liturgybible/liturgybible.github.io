            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not: thou shalt bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them, and receive them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment, and with every thing that is thy brother's, which is lost: if thou find it, neglect it not as pertaining to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If thou see thy brother's ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A woman shall not be clothed with man's apparel, neither shall a man use woman's apparel : for he that doeth these things is abominable before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird's nest in a tree, or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take her with her young:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught: that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to the roof round about: lest blood be shed in thy house, and thou be guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest both the seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be sanctified together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy cloak, wherewith thou shalt be covered.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And seek occasions to put her away, laying to her charge a very ill name, and say: I took this woman to wife, and going in to her, I found her not a virgin:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Her father and mother shall take her, and shall bring with them the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the gate:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the father shall say: I gave my daughter unto this man to wife: and because he hateth her,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He layeth to her charge a very ill name, so as to say: I found not thy daughter a virgin: and behold these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Condemning him besides in a hundred sides of silver, which he shall give to the damsel's father, because he hath defamed by a very ill name a virgin of Israel: and he shall have her to wife, and may not put her away all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not found in the damsel:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They shall cast her out of the doors of her father's house, and the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die: because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If a man lie with another man's wife, they shall both die, that is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress: and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one find her in the city, and lie with her,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and they shall be stoned: the damsel, because she cried not out, being in the city: the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife. And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But if a man find a damsel that is betrothed, in the field, and taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death : for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the damsel suffer:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> She was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man to help her.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment :</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sides of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled her: he may not put her away all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> No man shall take his father's wife, nor remove his covering.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:</p>

            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;</p>

            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;</p>
