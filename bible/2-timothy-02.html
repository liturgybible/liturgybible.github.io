            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others also.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The husbandman, that laboureth, must first partake of the fruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</p>
