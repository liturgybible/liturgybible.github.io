            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord : Behold, I devise an evil against this family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: how shall he depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon these, confusion shall not take them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The house of Jacob saith: Is the spirit of the Lord straitened, or are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise for ever from their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</p>
