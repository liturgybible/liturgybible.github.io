            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the days of David drew nigh that he should die, and he charged his son Solomon, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I am going the way of all flesh: take thou courage, and shew thyself a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and observe his ceremonies, and his precepts, and judgments, and testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses: that thou mayest understand all thou dost, and whithersoever thou shalt turn thyself :</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou knowest also what Joab the son of Sarvia hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to hell in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But shew kindness to the sons of Berzellai the Galaadite, and let them eat at thy table: t for they met me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast also with thee Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse, when I went to the camp: but because he came down to meet me when I passed over the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: I will not kill thee with a sword:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Do not thou hold him guiltless. But thou art a wise man, and knowest what to do with him, and thou shalt bring down his grey hairs with blood to hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the days that David reigned in Israel, were forty gears: in Hebron he reigned seven years, in Jerusalem thirty-three.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was strengthened exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Adonias the son of Haggith came to Bethsabee the mother of Solomon. And she said to him: Is thy coming peaceable? he answered: Peaceable.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he added: I have a word to speak with thee. She said to him: Speak. And he said:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou knowest that the kingdom was nine, and all Israel had preferred me to be their king: but the kingdom is transferred, and is become my brother's: for it was appointed him by the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now therefore I ask one petition of thee: turn not away my face. And she said to him: Say on.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said: I pray thee speak to king Solomon (for he cannot deny thee any thing) to give me Abisag the Sunamitess to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Bethsabee said: Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then Bethsabee came to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonias: and the king arose to meet her, and bowed to her, and sat down upon his throne: and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And she said to him: I desire one small petition of thee, do not put me to confusion. And the king said to her: My mother, ask: for I must not turn away thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And she said: Let Abisag the Sunamitess be given to Adonias thy brother to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag the Sunamitess for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom: for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Sarvia.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And now as the Lord liveth, who hath established me, and placed me upon the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonias shall be put to death this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaias the son of Joiada, who slew him, and he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the king said also to Abiathar the priest: Go to Anathoth to thy lands, for indeed thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst carry the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and hast endured trouble in all the troubles my father endured.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Deli in Silo.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord and laid hold on the horn of the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias the son of Joiada, saying: Go, kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Banaias came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him: Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said: I will not come forth, but here I will die. Banaias brought word back to the king, saying: Thus saith Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the king said to him: Do as he hath said: and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing it, Abner the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, general of the army of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And their blood shall return the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed and his house, and to his throne be peace for ever from the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> So Banaias the son of Joiada went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the king appointed Banaias the son of Joiada in his room over the army, and Sadoc the priest he put in the place of Abiathar.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any whither.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For on what day soever thou shalt go out, and shalt pass over the brook Cedron, know that thou shalt be put to death: thy blood shall be upon thy own head:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Semei said to the king: The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem, many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis the son of Maacha the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis to Geth to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And it was told Solomon that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any whither, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And the king said to Semei: Thou knowest all the evil, of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father: the Lord hath returned thy wickedness upon thy own head:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> So the king commanded Banaias the son of Joiada: and he went out and struck him, and he died.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p>
