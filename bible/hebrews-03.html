            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his voice,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of temptation in the desert,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>

            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>

            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
