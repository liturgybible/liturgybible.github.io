            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he passed from thence, to teach and preach in their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now when John had heard in prison the works of Christ: sending two of his disciples he said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Art thou he that art to come, or look we for another?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jesus making answer said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when they went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What went you out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are clothed in soft garments, are in the houses of kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But what went you out to see? a prophet? yea I tell you, and more than a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For this is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Amen I say to you, there hath not risen among them that are born of women a greater than John the Baptist: yet he that is the lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if you will receive it, he is Elias that is to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But whereunto shall I esteem this generation to be like? It is like to children sitting in the market place.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Who crying to their companions say: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have lamented, and you have not mourned.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For John came neither eating nor drinking; and they say: He hath a devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinners. And wisdom is justified by her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein were done the most of his miracles, for that they had not done penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Woe to thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And thou Capharnaum, shalt thou be exalted up to heaven? thou shalt go down even unto hell. For if in Sodom had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in thee, perhaps it had remained unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> At that time Jesus answered and said: I confess to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to the little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> All things are delivered to me by my Father. And no one knoweth the Son, but the Father: neither doth any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Come to me, all you that labour, and are burdened, and I will refresh you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Take up my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek, and humble of heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For my yoke is sweet and my burden light.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
