            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I testify again to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by charity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
