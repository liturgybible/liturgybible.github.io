            <p data-verse="46:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Thus saith the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east, shall be shut the six days, on which work is done; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened, yea and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate from without, and he shall stand at the threshold of the gate: and the priests shall offer his holocaust, and his peace offerings: and he shall adore upon the threshold of the gate, and shall go out: but the gate shall not be shut till the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people of the land shall adore at the door of that gate before the Lord on the sabbaths, and on the new moons.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the holocaust that the prince shall offer to the Lord on the sabbath day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the sacrifice of an ephi for a ram: but for the lambs what sacrifice his hand shall allow: and a hin of oil for every ephi.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And on the day of the new moon a calf of the herd without blemish: and the six lambs, and the rams shall be without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he shall offer in sacrifice an ephi for a calf, an ephi also for a ram: but for the lambs, as his hand shall find : and a hin of oil for every ephi.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the prince is to go in, let him go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and let him go out the same way.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But when the people of the land shall go in before the Lord in the solemn feasts, he that goeth in by the north gate to adore, shall go out by the way of the south gate : and he that; goeth in by the way of the south gate, shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go out at that over against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the prince in the midst of them, shall go in when they go in, and go out when they go out.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And in the fairs, and in the solemnities there shall be the sacrifice of an ephi to a calf, and an ephi to a ram: and to the lambs, the sacrifice shall be as his hand shall find: and a hin of oil to every ephi.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But when the prince shall offer a voluntary holocaust, or voluntary peace offerings to the Lord : the gate that looketh towards the east shall be opened to him, and he shall offer his holocaust, and his peace offerings, as it is wont to be done on the sabbath day: and he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he is gone forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he shall offer every day for a holocaust to the Lord, a lamb of the same year without blemish: he shall offer it always in the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he shall offer the sacrifice for it morning by morning, the sixth part of ephi: and the third part of a bin of oil be mingled with the fine hour: a to the Lord by ordinance continual and everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall offer the lamb, and the sacrifice, and the oil morning by morning: an everlasting holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the Lord God: If the prince give a gift to any of his sons: the inheritance of it shall go to his children, they shall possess it by inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if he give a legacy out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of release, and it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall go to his sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by violence, nor of their possession : but out of his own possession he shall give an inheritance to his sons: that my people be not dispersed every man from his possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he brought me in by the entry that was at the side of the gate, into the chambers of the sanctuary that were for the priests, which looked toward the north. And there was a place bending to the west.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall boil the sin offering, and the trespass offering: where they shall dress the sacrifice, that they may not bring it out into the outward court, and the people be sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he brought me into the outward court, and he led me about by the four corners of the court: and behold there was a little court in the corner of the court, to every corner of the court there was a little court.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed, forty cubits long, and thirty broad, all the four were of one measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there was a wall round about compassing the four little courts, and there were kitchens built under the rows round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said to me: This is the house of the kitchens wherein the ministers of the house of the Lord shall boil the victims of the people.</p>

            <p data-verse="46:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.</p>

            <p data-verse="46:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.</p>

            <p data-verse="46:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons’; it shall be their possession by inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Moreover the prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.</p>
