            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the body also is not one member, but many.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>

            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</p>
