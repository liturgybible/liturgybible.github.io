            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou hast cast me forth into the deep in the heart of the sea, and a flood hath compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see thy holy temple again.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.</p>
