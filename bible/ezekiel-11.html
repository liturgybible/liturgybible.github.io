            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of Banaias, princes of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the caldron, and we the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that; are round about you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died: and I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries: I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God: and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</p>
