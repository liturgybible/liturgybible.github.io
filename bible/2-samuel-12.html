            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord sent Nathan to David: and when he was come to him, he said to him: There were two men in one city, the one rich, and the other poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The rich man had exceeding many sheep and oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom: and it was unto him as a daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger, who was come to him, but took the poor man's ewe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David's anger being exceedingly kindled against that man, he said to Nathan: As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this is a child of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this thing, and had no pity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Nathan said to David: Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda: and if these things be little, I shall add far greater things unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to do evil in my sight? Thou hast killed Urias the Hethite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the Hethite to be thy wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes I and give them to thy neighhour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and in the sight of the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said to Nathan: I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David: The Lord also hath taken away thy sin: thou shalt not die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Nathan returned to his house. The Lord also struck the child which the wife of Urias had borne to David, and his life was despaired of.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David besought the Lord for the child: and David kept a fast, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat meat with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David feared to tell him, that the child was dead. For they said: Behold when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more will he afflict himself if we tell him that the child is dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But when David saw his servants whispering, he understood that the child was dead: and he said to his servants: Is the child dead? They answered him: He is dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then David arose from the ground, and washed and anointed himself: and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the house of the Lord: and worshipped, and then he came into his own house, and he called for bread, and ate.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And his servants said to him: What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive, but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said: While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept for him: for I said: Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give him to me, and the child may live?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him rather: but he shall not return to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And David comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto her, and slept with her: I and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon, and the Lord loved him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name, Amiable to the Lord, because the Lord loved him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and laid close siege to the royal city.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Joab sent messengers to David, saying: I have fought against Rabbath, and the city of waters is about to be taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people together, and besiege the city and take it: lest when the city shall be wasted by me, the victory be ascribed to my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then David gathered all the people together, and went out against Rabbath: and after fighting, he took it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold, set with most precious stones, and it was put upon David's head, and the spoils of the city which were very great he carried away.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and drove over them chariots armed with iron: and divided them with knives, and made them pass through brickkilns: so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon: and David returned, with all the army to Jerusalem.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p>
