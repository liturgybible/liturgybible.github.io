            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When thou wilt do good know to whom thou doest it; so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefits.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence; and if not from him, yet from the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> There can no good come to him that is always occupied in evil, nor to him that giveth no alms.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give to the godly man, and help not a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Do well unto him that is lowly, but give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not unto him, lest he overmaster thee thereby: for else thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Give unto the good, and help not the sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In the prosperity of a man enemies will be grieved: but in his adversity even a friend will depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Set him not by thee, lest, when he hath overthrown thee, he stand up in thy place; neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seek to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my words, and be pricked therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who will pity a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wild beasts?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sins, who will pity?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For a while he will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he will not tarry.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: he will weep with his eyes, but if he find opportunity, he will not be satisfied with blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If adversity come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first; and though he pretend to help thee, yet shall he undermine thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.</p>
