            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And in those days cometh John the Baptist preaching in the desert of Judea.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And saying: Do penance: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this is he that was spoken of by Isaias the prophet, saying: A voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the same John had his garment of camels' hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins: and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the country about Jordan:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: Ye brood of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father. For I tell you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I indeed baptize you in the water unto penance, but he that shall come after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor and gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, unto John, to be baptized by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But John stayed him, saying: I ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Jesus answering, said to him: Suffer it to be so now. For so it becometh us to fulfill all justice. Then he suffered him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jesus being baptized, forthwith came out of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him: and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And behold a voice from heaven, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
