            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Deliver me O Lord, and set me beside thee, and let any man's hand fight against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thou hast set their heart far from understanding, therefore they shall not be exalted.</p>
