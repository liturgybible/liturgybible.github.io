            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;</p>

            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</p>
