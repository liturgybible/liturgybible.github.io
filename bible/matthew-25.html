            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And five of them were foolish, and five wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But at last come also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>
