            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After the death of Josue the children of Israel consulted the Lord, saying: Who shall go up before us against the Chanaanite, and shall be the leader of the war?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said: Juda shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Juda said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and fight against the Chanaanite, that I also may go along with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Juda went up, and the Lord delivered the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite into their hands: and they slew of them in Bezec ten thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they found Adonibezec in Bezec, and fought against him, and they defeated the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Adonibezec said: Seventy kings having their fingers and toes cut off, gathered up the leavings of the meat under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the children of Juda besieging Jerusalem, took it, and put it to the sword, and set the whole city on fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And afterwards they went down and fought against the Chanaanite, who dwelt in the mountains, and in the south, and in the plains.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Juda going forward against the Chanaanite, that dwelt in Hebron (the name whereof was in former times Cariath-Arbe) slew Sesai, and Ahiman, and Tholmai:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And departing from thence he went to the inhabitants of Dabir, the ancient name of which was Cariath-Sepher, that is, the city of letters.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Caleb said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher, and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And as she was going on her way her husband admonished her to ask a field of her father. And as she sighed sitting on her ass, Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But she answered: Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also a watery land. So Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the children of the Cinite, the kinsman of Moses, went up from the city of palms, with the children of Juda into the wilderness of his lot, which is at the south side of Arad, and they dwelt with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Juda went with Simeon his brother, and they together defeated the Chanaanites that dwelt in Sephaath, and slew them. And the name of the city was called Horma, that is, Anathema.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Juda took Gaza with its confines, and Ascalon and Accaron with their confines.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Lord was with Juda, and he possessed the hill country: but was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, because they had many chariots armed with scythes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, who destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But the sons of Benjamin did not destroy the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem: and the Jebusite hath dwelt with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For when they were besieging the city, which before was called Luza,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him: Shew us the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when he had shewn them, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but that man and all his kindred they let go:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who being sent away, went into the land of Hethim, and built there a city, and called it Luza: which is so called until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Manasses also did not destroy Bethsan, and Thanac with their villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor, and Jeblaam, and Mageddo with their villages. And the Chanaanite began to dwell with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But after Israel was grown strong he made them tributaries, and would not destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Ephraim also did not slay the Chanaanite that dwelt in Gazer, but dwelt with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Zabulon destroyed not the inhabitants of Cetron, and Naalol: but the Chanaanite dwelt among them, and became their tributaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Aser also destroyed not the inhabitants of Accho, and of Sidon, of Ahalab, and of Achazib, and of Helba, and of Aphec, and of Rohob:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites the inhabitants of that land, and did not slay them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Nephtali also destroyed not the inhabitants of Bethsames, and of Bethanath: and he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites the inhabitants of the land, and the Bethsamites and Bethanites were tributaries to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the Amorrhite straitened the children of Dan in the mountain, and gave them not place to go down to the plain:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he dwelt in the mountain Hares, that is, of potsherds, in Aialon and Salebim. And the hand of the house of Joseph was heavy upon him, and he became tributary to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the border of the Amorrhite was from the ascent of the scorpion, the rock, and the higher places.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p>
