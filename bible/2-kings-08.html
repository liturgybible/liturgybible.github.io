            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Eliseus spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying: Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst find: for the Lord hath exiled a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to speak to the king for her house, and for her lands.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king talked with Giezi, the servant of the man of God, saying: Tell me all the great things that Eliseus hath done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when he was telling the king how he had raised one dead to life, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying to the king for her house, and her lands. And Giezi said: My lord O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Eliseus raised to life.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king asked the woman: and she told him. And the king appointed her an eunuch, saying: Restore her all that is hers, and all the revenues of the lands, from the day that she left the land, to this present.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Eliseus also came to Damascus, and Benadad king of Syria was sick: and they told him, saying: The man of God is come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the king said to Hazael: Take with thee presents, and go to meet the man of God, and consult the Lord by him, saying: Can I recover of this my illness?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Hazael went to meet him, taking with him presents, and all the good things of Damascus, the burdens of forty camels. And when he stood before him, he said: Thy son Benadad the king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying: Can I recover of this my illness?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Eliseus said to him: Go tell him: Thou shalt recover: bat the Lord hath shewn me that he shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he stood with him, and was troubled so far as to blush: and the man of God wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Hazael said to him: Why doth my lord weep? And he said: Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel. Their strong cities then wilt burn with fire, and their young men thou wilt kill with the sword, and thou wilt dash their children, and rip up their pregnant women.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Hazael said: But what am I thy servant a dog, that I should do this great thing? And Eliseus said: The Lord hath shewn me that thou shalt be king of Syria.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he was departed from Eliseus, he came to his master, who said to him: What saith Eliseus to thee? And he answered: He told me: Thou shalt recover.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And on the next day he took a blanket, and pouted water on it, and spread it upon his face: and he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In the fifth year of Joram son of Achab king of Israel, and of Josaphat king of Juda, reigned Joram son of Josaphat king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He was two and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked: for the daughter of Achab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But the Lord would not destroy Juda, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him, to give him a light, and to his children always.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In his days Edom revolted, from being under Juda, and made themselves a king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him: and he arose in the night, and defeated the Edomites that had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots, but the people fled into their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So Edom revolted from being under Juda, unto this day. Then Lobna also revolted at the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias his son reigned in Iris stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achab king of Israel, reigned Ochozias son of Joram king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Ochozias was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri king of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab: and he did evil before the Lord, as did the house of Achab: for he was the son in law of the house of Achab.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He went also with Joram son of Achab, to fight against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Joram:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he went back to be healed, in Jezrahel: because the Syrians had wounded him in Ramoth when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel, because he was sick there.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>
