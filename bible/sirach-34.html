            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Whoso regardeth dreams is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another, even as the likeness of a face to a face.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Of an unclean thing what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false what truth can come?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman’s heart in travail.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If they be not sent from the most High in thy visitation, set not thy heart upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A man that hath travelled knoweth many things; and he that hath much experience will declare wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He that hath no experience knoweth little: but he that hath travelled is full of prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> When I travelled, I saw many things; and I understand more than I can express.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I was ofttimes in danger of death: yet I was delivered because of these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; for their hope is in him that saveth them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whoso feareth the Lord shall not fear nor be afraid; for he is his hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doth he look? and who is his strength?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For the eyes of the Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, a preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He raiseth up the soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous; and the gifts of unjust men are not accepted.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The most High is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked; neither is he pacified for sin by the multitude of sacrifices.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Whoso bringeth an offering of the goods of the poor doeth as one that killeth the son before his father’s eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The bread of the needy is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof is a man of blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He that taketh away his neighbour’s living slayeth him; and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodshedder.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When one buildeth, and another pulleth down, what profit have they then but labour?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lord hear?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that washeth himself after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his washing?</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So is it with a man that fasteth for his sins, and goeth again, and doeth the same: who will hear his prayer? or what doth his humbling profit him?</p>
