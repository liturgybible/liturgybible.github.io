            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may know his works.</p>

            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Hearken to these things, Job : Stand, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his light of his clouds?</p>

            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>

            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>

            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</p>

            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
