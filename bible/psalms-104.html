            <p data-verse="104:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> and art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> and that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> there the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about:</p>
            <p data-verse="104:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall lie down in their dens.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> How great are thy works, O Lord? thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> All expect of thee that thou give them food in season.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="104:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord.</p>
