            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR IGNORANCES.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, and was afraid. O Lord, thy work, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> God will come from the south, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> His brightness shall be as the light; horns are in his hands: There is his strength hid:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and melted the nations: and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: for salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest the head of the house of the wicked: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the mud of many waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have heard and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: that I may go up to our people that are girded.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</p>
