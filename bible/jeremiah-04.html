            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return to me: if thou wilt take away thy stumblingblocks out of my sight, thou shalt not be moved.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth, and in judgement, and in justice: and the Gentiles shall bless him, and shall praise him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem: Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon thorns:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be none that can quench it: because of the wickedness of your thoughts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem: speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay not: for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining without an inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For this gird yourselves with haircloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord: That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes: and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, hast thou then deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: You shall have peace: and behold the sword reacheth even to the soul?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> At that time it shall be said to this people, and to Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I will speak my judgments with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Behold he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we are laid waste.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice of the idol from mount Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in Jerusalem, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They are set round about her, as keepers of fields: because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They ways, and thy devices have brought these things upon thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My bowels, my bowels are in pain, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a moment.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the heavens, and there was no light in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of the air were gone.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilderness: and all its cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the wrath of his indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away; they have entered into thickets and have climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do? though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail, anguishes as of a woman in labor of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trump, the alarm of war.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.</p>
