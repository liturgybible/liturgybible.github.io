            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in remembrance.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Forgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> One man beareth hatred against another, and doth he seek pardon from the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himself: and doth he ask forgiveness of his own sins?</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins?</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Remember thy end, and let enmity cease; remember corruption and death, and abide in the commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember the commandments, and bear no malice to thy neighbour: remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at ignorance.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Abstain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for a furious man will kindle strife,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A sinful man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a man’s strength is, so is his wrath; and according to his riches his anger riseth; and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> An hasty contention kindleth a fire: and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou blow the spark, it shall burn: if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: and both these come out of thy mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Curse the whisperer and doubletongued: for such have destroyed many that were at peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A backbiting tongue hath cast out virtuous women, and deprived them of their labours.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Whoso hearkeneth unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh: but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Many have fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as have fallen by the tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Well is he that is defended through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor hath been bound in her bands.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The death thereof is an evil death, the grave were better than it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> It shall not have rule over them that fear God, neither shall they be burned with the flame thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Look that thou hedge thy possession about with thorns, and bind up thy silver and gold,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door and bar for thy mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait.</p>
