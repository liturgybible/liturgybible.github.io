            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal: and prophesy of him,</p>

            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will turn thee about, and I will put a bit in thy jaws: and I will bring thee forth, and ail thy army, horses and horsemen all clothed with coats of mail, a great multitude, armed with spears and shields and swords.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans with them, all with shields and helmets.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Gomer, and all his bands, the house of Thogorma, the northern parts and all his strength, and many peoples with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Prepare and make thyself ready, and all thy multitude that is assembled about thee, and be thou commander over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> After many days thou shalt be visited: at the end of years thou shalt come to the land that is returned from the sword, and is gathered out of many nations, to the mountains of Israel which have been continually waste: but it hath been brought forth out of the nations, and they shall all of them dwell securely in</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt go up and come like a storm, and like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands and many people with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus saith the Lord God: In that day projects shall enter into thy heart, and thou shalt conceive a mischievous design.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou shalt say: I will go up to the land which is without a wall, I will come to them that are at rest, and dwell securely: all these dwell without a wall, they have no bars nor gates :</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> To take spoils, and lay hold on the prey, to lay thy hand upon them that had been wasted, and afterwards restored, and upon the people that is gathered together out of the nations, which hath begun to possess and to dwell in the midst of the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="38:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Thou then art he, of whom I have spoken in the days of old, by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in the days of those times that I would bring thee upon them.</p>

            <p data-verse="38:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be pointed against his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hailstones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations that are with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified: and I will be known in the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
