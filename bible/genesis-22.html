            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for a holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they came to the place which God had shown him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the seashore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> After these things, it was told Abraham that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Hus the firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: These eight did Melcha bear to Nachor Abraham's brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;</p>

            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</p>
