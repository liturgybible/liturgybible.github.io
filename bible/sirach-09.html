            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Give not thy soul unto a woman to set her foot upon thy substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Meet not with an harlot, lest thou fall into her snares.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Gaze not on a maid, that thou fall not by those things that are precious in her.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Give not thy soul unto harlots, that thou lose not thine inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Look not round about thee in the streets of the city, neither wander thou in the solitary place thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Turn away thine eye from a beautiful woman, and look not upon another’s beauty; for many have been deceived by the beauty of a woman; for herewith love is kindled as a fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Sit not at all with another man’s wife, nor sit down with her in thine arms, and spend not thy money with her at the wine; lest thine heart incline unto her, and so through thy desire thou fall into destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Envy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Delight not in the thing that the ungodly have pleasure in; but remember they shall not go unpunished unto their grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill; so shalt thou not doubt the fear of death: and if thou come unto him, make no fault, lest he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest upon the battlements of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As near as thou canst, guess at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let thy talk be with the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And let just men eat and drink with thee; and let thy glorying be in the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the hand of the artificer the work shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people for his speech.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his city; and he that is rash in his talk shall be hated.</p>
