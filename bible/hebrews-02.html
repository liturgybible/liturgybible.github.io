            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if the word, spoken by angels, became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him: or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast set him over the works of thy hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God, he might taste death for all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For no where doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p>
