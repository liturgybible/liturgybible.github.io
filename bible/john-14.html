            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And whither I go you know, and the way you know.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Otherwise believe for the very works' sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence.</p>
