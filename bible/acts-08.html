            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And there was great joy in that city.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>

            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
