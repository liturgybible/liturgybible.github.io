            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men..</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Hear ye therefore my reproof, and attend to the judgment of my lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Hath God any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for him?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Do you accept his person, and do you endeavour to judge for God?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Or shall it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed ? or shall he be deceived as a man, with your deceitful dealings ?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He shall reprove you, because in secret you accept his person.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As soon as he shall move himself, he shall trouble you: and his dread shall fall upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Your remembrance shall be compared to ashes, and your necks shall be brought to clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Hold your peace a little while, that I may speak whatsoever my mind shall suggest to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?</p>

            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he shall be my saviour: for no hypocrite shall come before his presence.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Two things only do not to me, and then from thy face I shall not be hid:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Withdraw thy hand far from me, and let not thy dread terrify me.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thy enemy?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Against a leaf, that is carried away with the wind, thou shewest thy power, and thou pursuest a dry straw.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For thou writest bitter things against me, and wilt consume me for the sins of my youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Thou hast put my feet in the stocks, and hast observed all my paths, and hast considered the steps of my feet:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Who am to be consumed as rottenness, and as a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</p>

            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</p>

            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</p>
