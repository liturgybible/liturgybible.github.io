            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him under the sun?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A good name is better than precious ointments: and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the living thinketh what is to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Anger is better than laughter: because by the sadness of the countenance the mind of the offender is corrected.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> It is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to be deceived by the flattery of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: now this also is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall destroy the strength of his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Better is the end of a speech than the beginning. Better is the patient man than the presumptuous.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Be not quickly angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Say not: What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than they are now? for this manner of question is foolish.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wisdom with riches is more profitable, and bringeth more advantage to them that see the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a defence : but learning and wisdom excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Consider the works of God, that no man can correct whom he hath despised.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In the good day enjoy good things, and beware beforehand of the evil day: for God hath made both the one and the other, that man may not find against him any just complaint.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These things also I saw in the days of my vanity: A just man perisheth in his justice, and a wicked man liveth a long time in his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Be not over just: and be not more wise than is necessary, lest thou become stupid.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Be not overmuch wicked: and be not foolish, lest thou die before thy time.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> It is good that thou shouldst hold up the just, yea and from him withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God, neglecteth nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For there is no just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken: lest perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil of others.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> I have tried all things in wisdom. I have said: I will be wise: and it departed farther from me,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Much more than it was: it is a great depth, who shall find it out?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I have surveyed all things with my mind, to know, and consider, and seek out wisdom and reason: and to know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I have found a woman more bitter than death, who is the hunter's snare, and her heart is a net, and her hands are bands. He that pleaseth God shall escape from her: but he that is a sinner, shall be caught by her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Lo this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after another, that I might find out the account,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, and I have not found it. One man among a thousand I have found, a woman among them all I have not found.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Only this I have found, that God made man right, and he hath entangled himself with an infinity of questions. Who is as the wise man? and who hath known the resolution of the word?</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p>
