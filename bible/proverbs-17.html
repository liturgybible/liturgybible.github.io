            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> It is better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool trusting in his own folly.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
