            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy, and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the day following we came to Sidon. And Julius treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, and to take care of himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And sailing over the sea of Cilicia, and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when for many days we had sailed slowly, and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when much time was spent, and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and northwest.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And running under a certain island, that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard, and so were driven.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And we being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they lightened the ship.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and have gained this harm and loss.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but only of the ship.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, stood by me this night,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And we must come unto a certain island.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms; and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited, and continued fasting, taking nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for your health's sake; for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then were they all of better cheer, and they also took some meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And we were in all in the ship, two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands; and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground; and the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And the soldiers' counsel was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out, should escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done; and he commanded that they who could swim, should cast themselves first into the sea, and save themselves, and get to land.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And the rest, some they carried on boards, and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass, that every soul got safe to land.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p>

            <p data-verse="27:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p>
            <p data-verse="27:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</p>
