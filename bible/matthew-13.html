            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The same day Jesus going out of the house, sat by the sea side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And great multitudes were gathered unto him, so that he went up into a boat and sat: and all the multitude stood on the shore.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying: Behold the sower went forth to sow.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And whilst he soweth some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate them up.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And other some fell upon stony ground, where they had not much earth: and they sprung up immediately, because they had no deepness of earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the sun was up they were scorched: and because they had not root, they withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And others fell among thorns: and the thorns grew up and choked them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And others fell upon good ground: and they brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And his disciples came and said to him: Why speakest thou to them in parables?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who answered and said to them: Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven: but to them it is not given.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given, and he shall abound: but he that hath not, from him shall be taken away that also which he hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore do I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the prophecy of Isaias is fulfilled in them, who saith: By hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand: and seeing you shall see, and shall not perceive.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears they have been dull of hearing, and their eyes they have shut: lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For, amen, I say to you, many prophets and just men have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Hear you therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, there cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart: this is he that received the seed by the way side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he that received the seed upon stony ground, is he that heareth the word, and immediately receiveth it with joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yet hath he not root in himself, but is only for a time: and when there ariseth tribulation and persecution because of the word, he is presently scandalized.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he that received the seed among thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choketh up the word, and he becometh fruitless.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he that received the seed upon good ground, is he that heareth the word, and understandeth, and beareth fruit, and yieldeth the one an hundredfold, and another sixty, and another thirty.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Another parable he proposed to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man that sowed good seeds in his field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But while men were asleep, his enemy came and oversowed cockle among the wheat and went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when the blade was sprung up, and had brought forth fruit, then appeared also the cockle.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the servants of the goodman of the house coming said to him: Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it cockle?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he said to them: An enemy hath done this. And the servants said to him: Wilt thou that we go and gather it up?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he said: No, lest perhaps gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Suffer both to grow until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the cockle, and bind it into bundles to burn, but the wheat gather ye into my barn.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Another parable he proposed unto them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it is grown up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come, and dwell in the branches thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Another parable he spoke to them: The kingdom of heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes: and without parables he did not speak to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then having sent away the multitudes, he came into the house, and his disciples came to him, saying: Expound to us the parable of the cockle of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Who made answer and said to them: He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the field, is the world. And the good seed are the children of the kingdom. And the cockle, are the children of the wicked one.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the enemy that sowed them, is the devil. But the harvest is the end of the world. And the reapers are the angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Even as cockle therefore is gathered up, and burnt with fire: so shall it be at the end of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and them that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Then shall the just shine as the sun, in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field. Which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant seeking good pearls.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Who when he had found one pearl of great price, went his way, and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Again the kingdom of heaven is like to a net cast into the sea, and gathering together of all kind of fishes.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Which, when it was filled, they drew out, and sitting by the shore, they chose out the good into vessels, but the bad they cast forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> So shall it be at the end of the world. The angels shall go out, and shall separate the wicked from among the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Have ye understood all these things? They say to him: Yes.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And it came to pass: when Jesus had finished these parables, he passed from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogues, so that they wondered and said: How came this man by this wisdom and miracles?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Jude:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence therefore hath he all these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And they were scandalized in his regard. But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And he wrought not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>

            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>

            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>

            <p data-verse="13:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
