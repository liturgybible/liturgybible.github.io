            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that country.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his soul was fast knit unto her, and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this damsel to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to Jacob,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob's daughter,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem has a longing for your daughter: give her him to wife:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And let us contract marriages one with another: give us your daughters and take you our daughters,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till, trade,and possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren: Let me find favor in your sight: and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Raise the dowery,, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their sister:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is uncircumcised, which with us is unlawful and abominable.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But in this way may we be allied with you, if you will be like us, and all the male sex among you be circumcised:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours: and we will dwell with you, and will be one people:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem his son:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what was required, for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And going into the gate of the city they spoke to the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> These men are peaceable and willing to dwell with us: let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will give them ours.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall be ours: only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was greatest, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city, and slew all the men:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister Dina, out of Sichem's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they took their sheep and their herds and their asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in the fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> and their children and wives they took captive,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land: we are few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house, shall be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?</p>

            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?</p>
