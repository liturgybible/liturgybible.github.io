For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose out of Israel, and will make them rest upon their own ground: and the stranger shall be joined with them, and shall adhere to the house of Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the people shall take them, and bring them into their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids: and they shall make them captives that had taken them, and shall subdue their oppressors.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that when God shall give thee rest from thy labour, and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage, wherewith thou didst serve before,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thou shalt take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and shalt say: How is the oppressor come to nothing, the tribute hath ceased?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the rod of the rulers,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That struck the people in wrath with an incurable wound, that brought nations under in fury, that persecuted in a cruel manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The whole earth is quiet and still, it is glad and hath rejoiced.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The fir trees also have rejoiced over thee, and the cedars of Libanus, saying: Since thou hast slept, there hath none come up to cut us down.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Hell below was in an uproar to meet thee at thy coming, it stirred up the giants for thee. All the princes of the earth are risen up from their thrones, all the princes of nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> All shall answer, and say to thee: Thou also art wounded as well as we, thou art become like unto us.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Howl, O gate; cry, O city: all Philistia is thrown down: for a smoke shall come from the north, and there is none that shall escape his troop.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And what shall be answered to the messengers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded Sion, and the poor of his people shall hope in him.</p>
