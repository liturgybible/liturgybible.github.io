            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My son, keep the flower of thine age sound; and give not thy strength to strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> When thou hast gotten a fruitful possession through all the field, sow it with thine own seed, trusting in the goodness of thy stock.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So thy race which thou leavest shall be magnified, having the confidence of their good descent.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> An harlot shall be accounted as spittle; but a married woman is a tower against death to her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> A wicked woman is given as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is given to him that feareth the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A dishonest woman contemneth shame: but an honest woman will reverence her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> A shameless woman shall be counted as a dog; but she that is shamefaced will fear the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A woman that honoureth her husband shall be judged wise of all; but she that dishonoureth him in her pride shall be counted ungodly of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.</p>
