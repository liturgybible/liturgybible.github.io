            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end. A psalm for David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Whilst the wicked man is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In the Lord I put my trust: how then do you say to my soul: Get thee away from hence to the mountain like a sparrow?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow; they have prepared their arrows in the quiver; to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The sinner hath provoked the Lord according to the multitude of his wrath he will not seek him:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made: but what has the just man done?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over all his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes look on the poor man: his eyelids examine the sons of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from generation to generation, and shall be without evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The Lord trieth the just and the wicked: but he that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone and storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places, that he may kill the innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice: his countenance hath beheld righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and fall, when he shall have power over the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see to the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou seest it, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Break thou the arm of the sinner and of the malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> To judge for the fatherless and for the humble, that man may no more presume to magnify himself upon earth.</p>
