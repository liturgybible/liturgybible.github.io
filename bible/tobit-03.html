            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their generation, obedience and love.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do that you may be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For God hath made the father honourable to the children: and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sine by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up a treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him, and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the relieving of the father shall not be for- gotten.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sine shall melt away as the ice in the fair warm weather.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured by the humble.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that loveth danger shall perish in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add sin to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not be perceived.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> A wise heart, and which hath under- standing, will abstain from sine, and in the works of justice shall have success.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.</p>
