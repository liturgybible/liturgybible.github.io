            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And when they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He answered: Tarry here this night, and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What mean these men that are with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</p>
