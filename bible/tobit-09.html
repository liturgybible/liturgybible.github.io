            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, lest she shew in thy regard the malice of a wicked lesson.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Give not the power of thy soul to a woman, lest she enter upon thy strength, and thou be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Look not upon a woman that hath a mind for many: lest thou fall into her snares.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Use not much the company of her that is a dancer, and hearken not to her, lest thou perish by the force of her charms.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Gaze not upon a maiden, lest her beauty be a stumblingblock to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Give not thy soul to harlots in any point: lest thou destroy thyself and thy inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Look not round about thee in the of the city, nor wander up and down in the streets thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up, and gaze not about upon another's beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For many have perished by the beauty of a woman, and hereby lust is enkindled as a fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Every woman that is a harlot, shall be trodden upon as dung in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Many by admiring the beauty of another man's wife, have become reprobate, for her conversation burneth as fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Sit not at all with another man's wife, nor repose upon the bed with her:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And strive not with her over wine, lest thy heart decline towards her, and by thy blood thou fall into destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Forsake not an old friend, for the new will not be like to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A new friend is as new wine: it shall grow old, and thou shalt drink it with pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Envy not the glory and riches of a sinner: for thou knowest not what his ruin shall be.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Be not pleased with the wrong done by the unjust, knowing that even to hell the wicked shall not please.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Keep thee far from the man that hath power to kill, so thou shalt not suspect the fear of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And if thou come to him, commit no fault, lest he take away thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Know it to be a communication with death: for thou art going in the midst of snares, and walking upon the arms of them that are grieved:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> According to thy power beware of thy neighbor, and treat with the wise and prudent.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let just men be thy guests, and let thy glory be in the fear of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And let the thought of God be in thy mind, and all thy discourse on the commandments of the Highest.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Works shall be praised for the hand of the artificers, and the prince of the people for the wisdom of his speech, but word of the ancients for the sense.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> A man full of tongue is terrible in his city, and he that is rash in his word shall be hateful.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, and bring him to the wedding.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he will be very sorry.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And early in the morning they went forth both together, and came to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.</p>
