            <p data-verse="28:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And you shall remain few in number, who before were as the stars of heaven for multitude, because thou heardst not the voice of the Lord thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And as the Lord rejoiced upon you before doing good to you, and multiplying you: so he shall rejoice destroying and bringing you to nought, so that you shall be taken away from the land which thou shalt go in to possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> The Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the farthest parts of the earth to the ends thereof: and there thou shalt serve strange gods, which both thou art ignorant of and thy fathers, wood and stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Neither shalt thou be quiet, even in those nations, nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot. For the Lord will give thee a fearful heart, and languishing eyes, and a soul consumed with pensiveness:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And thy life shall be as it were hanging before thee. Thou shalt fear night and day, neither shalt thou trust thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> In the morning thou shalt say: Who will grant me evening? and at evening: Who will grant me morning? for the fearfulness of thy heart, wherewith thou shalt be terrified, and for those things which thou shalt see with thy eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt, by the way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more. There shalt thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</p>
