            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thus she did every year, when the time returned that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then Elcana her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? And why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And Heli the priest sitting upon a stool, before the door of the temple of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And she made a vow, saying: O Lord, of hosts, if thou wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And said to her: How long wilt thou, be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: and the Lord remembered her.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Elcana her husband went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Elcana her husband said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman stayed at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</p>
