            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Baltasar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles: and every one drank according to his age.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And being now drunk he commanded that they should bring the vessels of gold and silver which Nabuchodonosor his father had brought away out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, that the king and his nobles, and his wives and his concubines, might drink in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then were the golden and silver vessels brought, which he had brought away out of the temple that was in Jerusalem: and the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, drank in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They drank wine, and praised their gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In the same hour there appeared fingers, as it were of the hand of a man, writing over against the candlestick upon the surface of the wall of the king's palace: and the king beheld the joints of the hand that wrote.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then was the king's countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him: and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees struck one against the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the king cried out aloud to bring in the wise men, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon: Whosoever shall read this writing, and shall make known to me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and shall have a golden chain on his neck, and shall be the third man in my kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then came in all the king's wise men, but they could neither read the writing, nor declare the interpretation to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherewith king Baltasar was much troubled, and his countenance was changed: and his nobles also were troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then the queen, on occasion of what had happened to the king, and his nobles, came into the banquet house: and she spoke and said: O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, neither let thy countenance be changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy gods in him: and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were found in him: for king Nabuchodonosor thy father appointed him prince of the wise men, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers, thy father, I say, O king:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because a greater spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, and interpretation of dreams, and shewing of secrets, and resolving of difficult things, were found in him, that is, in Daniel: whom the king named Baltarsar. Now therefore let Daniel be called for, and he will tell the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke, and said to him: Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda, whom my father the king brought out of Judea?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have heard of thee, that thou hast the spirit of the gods, and excellent knowledge, and understanding, and wisdom are found in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And now the wise men the magicians have come in before me, to read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof: and they could not declare to me the meaning of this writing.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But I have heard of thee, that thou canst interpret obscure things, and resolve difficult things: now if thou art able to read the writing, and to shew me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and shalt have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third prince in my kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> To which Daniel made answer, and said before the king: Thy rewards be to thyself, and the gifts of thy house give to another: but the writing I will read to thee, O king, and shew thee the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> O king, the most high God gave to Nabuchodonosor thy father a kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And for the greatness that he gave to him, all people, tribes, and languages trembled, and were afraid of him: whom he would, he slew: and whom he would, he destroyed: and whom he would, he set up: and whom he would, he brought down.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened unto pride, he was put down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory was taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he was driven out from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses, and he did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till he knew that the most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he will set over it whomsoever it shall please him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou also his son, O Baltasar, hast not humbled thy heart, whereas thou knewest all these things:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But hast lifted thyself up against the Lord of heaven: and the vessels of his house have been brought before thee: and thou, and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines have drunk wine in them: and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and of gold, and of brass, of iron, and of wood, and of stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor feel: but the God who hath thy breath in his hand, and all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wherefore he hath sent the part of the hand which hath written this that is set down.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And this is the writing that is written: MANE, THECEL, PHARES.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And this is the interpretation of the word. MANE: God hath numbered thy kingdom, and hath finished it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> THECEL: thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> PHARES: thy kingdom is divided, and is given to the Medes and Persians.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then by the king's command Daniel was clothed with purple, and a chain of gold was put about his neck: and it was proclaimed of him that he had power as the third man in the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The same night Baltasar the Chaldean king was slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Darius the Mede succeeded to the kingdom, being threescore and two years old.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.</p>
