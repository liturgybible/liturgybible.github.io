            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over, and a net spread upon Thabor.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And you have turned aside victims into the depth: and I am, the teacher of them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now Ephraim hath committed fornication, Israel is defiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They will not set their thoughts to return to their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the pride of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Juda also shall fall with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> With their flocks, and with their herds, they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find him: he is withdrawn from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They have transgressed against the Lord, for they have begotten children that are strangers: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Blow ye the cornet in Gabaa, the trumpet in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back, O Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel I have shewn that which shall surely be.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The princes of Juda are become as they that take up the bound: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ephraim is under oppression, and broken in judgment: because he began to go after filthiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will be like a moth to Ephraim: and like rottenness to the house of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Juda his band: and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and sent to the avenging king: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to take off the band from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For I will be like a lioness to Ephraim, and like a lion's whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will catch, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can rescue.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I will go and return to my place: until you are consumed, and seek my face.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</p>
