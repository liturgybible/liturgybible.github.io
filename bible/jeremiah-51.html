            <p data-verse="51:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall fan her, and shall destroy her land: for they are come upon her on every side in the day of her affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let not him that bendeth, bend his bow, and let not, him go up that is armed with a coat of mail: spare not her young men, destroy all her army.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and the wounded in the regions thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God the Lord of hosts: but their land hath been filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every one save his own life: be not silent upon her iniquity: for it is the time of revenge from the Lord, he will I render unto her what she hath deserved.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine, and therefore they have staggered.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land: because her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up to the clouds.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Lord hath brought forth our justices: Come, and let us declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers, the Lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: and his mind is against Babylon to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard, strengthen the watch: set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord hath both purposed, and done all that he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, rich in treasures, thy end is come for thy entire destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying : I will fill thee with men as with locusts, and they shall lift up a joyful shout against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that made the earth by his power, that hath prepared the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in heaven: he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth, he hath turned lightning into rain: and hath brought forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Every man is become foolish by his knowledge: every founder is confounded by his idol, for what he hath cast is a lie, and there is no breath in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They are vain works, and worthy to be laughed at, in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he that made all things he it is, and Israel is the sceptre of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war, and with thee I will dash nations together, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And with thee I will break in pieces the horse, and his rider, and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot, and him that getteth up into it:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child, and with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his dock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces captains and rulers.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I will render to Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil, that they have done in Sion, before your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Behold I come against thee, thou destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which corruptest the whole earth: and I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for ever, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Set ye up a standard in the land: sound with the trumpet among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call together against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: number Taphsar against her, bring the horse as the stinging locust.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media, their captains, and all their rulers, and all the land of their dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be troubled: for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake, to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are become as women: her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall meet messenger: to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one end to the other:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a thrashingfloor, this is the time of her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath eaten me up, he hath devoured me: he hath made me as an empty vessel: he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats, and he hath cast me out.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The wrong done to me, and my flesh be upon Babylon, saith the habitation of Sion : and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, saith Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will judge thy cause, and will take vengeance for thee, and I will make her sea desolate, and will dry up her spring.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment and a hissing, because there is no inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> They shall roar together like lions, they shall shake their manes like young lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> In their heat I will set them drink: and I will make them drunk, that they may slumber, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and awake no more, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and like rams with kids.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> How is Sesach taken, and the renowned one of all the earth surprised? How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The sea is come up over Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man pass through it.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down: and the rations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of Babylon shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Go out of the midst of her, my people: that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land : and a rumour shall come in one year, and after this year another rumour: and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Therefore behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel: so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: because strangers are come upon the sanctuaries of the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded shall groan:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her strength on high: from me there should come spoilers upon her, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans :</p>
            <p data-verse="51:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice: and their wave shall roar like many waters: their voice hath made a noise:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And I will make her princes drunk. and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men: and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the whose name is Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire, and shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> The word that Jeremias the prophet commanded Saraias the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,</p>
            <p data-verse="51:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> Thou shalt say: O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it: so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far are the words of Jeremias.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!</p>
            <p data-verse="51:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;</p>
            <p data-verse="51:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p>
