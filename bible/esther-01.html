            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now in the third year of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces in his sight,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there were hung up on every side sky coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds also were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels one after another. Wine also in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king's magnificence.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Also Vasthi the queen made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people and the princes: for she was exceeding beautiful.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But she refused, and would not come at the king's commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Baked the wise men, who according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> (Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians, and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him :)</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And by this example all the wives of the princes of the Persians and the Medes will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore the king's indignation is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire, (which is very wide,) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</p>
