            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the tribes, twelve rods, and write the name of every man upon his rod.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi, and one rod shall contain all their families:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, wherewith they murmur against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and all the princes gave him rods one for every tribe: and there were twelve rods besides the rod of Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Moses had laid them up before the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He returned on the following day, and found that the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded: and that the buds swelling it had bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves, were formed into almonds.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel: and they saw, and every one received their rods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back the rod of Aaron into the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be kept there for a token of the rebellious children of Israel, and that their complaints may cease from me lest they die.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the children of Israel said to Moses: Behold we are consumed, we all perish.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.</p>
