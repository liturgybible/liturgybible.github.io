            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, and write in it with a man's pen. Take sway the spoils with speed, quickly take the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Urias the priest, and Zacharias the son of Barachias.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: Make haste to take away the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of the Assyrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Basin, and the son of Romelia:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall overflow all his banks,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Emmanuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome, and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, end be overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone or stumbling, and for a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel, for a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will wait for the Lord, who hath hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold I and my children, whom the Lord hath given me for a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning light.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they shall pass by it, they shall fall, and be hungry: and when they shall be hungry, they will be angry, and curse their king, and their God, and look upwards.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they shall look to the earth, and behold trouble and darkness, weakness and distress, and a mist following them, and they cannot fly away from their distress.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.</p>
