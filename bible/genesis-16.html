            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Sarai the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children; having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her request,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her its it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore she called that well, The well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Bared.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Abram was fourscore and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.</p>
