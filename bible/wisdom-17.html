            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed: therefore unnurtured souls have erred.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation; they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly astonished, and troubled with strange apparitions.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear: but noises as of waters falling down sounded about them, and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, and their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours which reason offereth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the expectation from within, being less, counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeed intolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partly fainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut up in a prison without iron bars,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer in the field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain of darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of water running violently,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the whole world shined with clear light, and none were hindered in their labour:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.</p>
