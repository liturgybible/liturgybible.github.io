            <p data-verse="39:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine linen, the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in the holy places, as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> So he made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With embroidered work: and he cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the aforesaid colours,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And two borders coupled one to the other in the top on either side,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And a girdle of the same colours, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, and graven by the art of a lapidary, with the names of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he set them in the sides of the ephod for a memorial of the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He made also a rational with embroidered work, according to the work of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Foursquare, double, of the measure of a span.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he set four rows of precious stones in it. In the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and emerald.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an amethyst.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl, set and enclosed in gold by their rows.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several name.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They made also in the rational little chains linked one to another of the purest gold,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they set the rings on either side of the rational,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> On which rings the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of the ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> These both before and behind so answered one another, that the ephod and the rational were bound together,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They made also the tunick of the ephod all of violet,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And a hole for the head in the upper part at the middle, and a woven border round about the hole:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And little bells of the purest gold, which they put between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunick round about:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> They made also fine linen tunicks with woven work for Aaron and his sons:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And mitres with their little crowns of fine linen:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And linen breeches of fine linen:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a lapidary, The Holy of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all things which the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they offered the tabernacle and the roof and the whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars, and their sockets,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the other cover of violet skins,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves of proposition:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them with the oil:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pillars with their sockets:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle, and for the roof of the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron and his sons, used in the sanctuary,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The children of Israel offered as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And when Moses saw all things finished, he blessed them.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;</p>
            <p data-verse="39:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,</p>

            <p data-verse="39:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
