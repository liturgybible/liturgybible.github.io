            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Instead of a friend become not an enemy to thy neighbour: for an evil man shall inherit reproach and shame, so shall every sinner that is envious and double tongued.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Extol not thyself in the thoughts of thy soul like a bull: lest thy strength be quashed by folly,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it eat up thy leaves, and destroy thy fruit: and thou be left as a dry tree in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and maketh him to be a joy to his enemies, and shall lead him into the lot of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A sweet word multiplieth friends, and appeaseth enemies, and a gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Be in peace with many, but let one of a thousand be thy counsellor.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If thou wouldst get a friend, try him before thou takest him, and do not credit him easily.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For there is a friend for his own occasion, and he will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there is a friend that turneth to enmity; and there is a friend that will disclose hatred and strife and reproaches.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there is a friend a companion at the table, and he will not abide in the day of distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> A friend ii he continue steadfast, shall be to thee as thyself, and shall act with confidence among them of thy household.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If he humble himself before thee, and hide himself from thy face, thou shalt have unanimous friendship for good.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found him, hath found a treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend, and no weight of gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A faithful friend is the medicine of life and immortality: and they that fear the Lord, shall find him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship: because according to him shall his friend be.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> My son, from thy youth up receive instruction, and even to thy grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Come to her as one that plougheth, and soweth, and wait for her good fruits:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her fruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> How very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned, and the unwise will not continue with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial, and they will cast her from them before it be long.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many, but with them to whom she is known, she continueth even to the sight of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Give ear, my son, and take wise counsel, and cast not away my advice.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chains:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bands.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Come to her with all thy mind, and keep her ways with all thy power.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Search for her, and she shall be made known to thee, and when thou hast gotten her, let her not go:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her, and she shall be turned to thy joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and a firm foundation, and her chain a robe of glory:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For in her is the beauty of life, and her bands are a healthful binding.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory, and thee shalt set her upon thee as a crown of joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> My son, if thou wilt attend to me, thou shalt learn: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt receive instruction: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise, and join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom, that thou mayst hear every discourse of God, and the sayings of praise may not escape thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And if thou see a man of understanding, go to him early in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God, and meditate continually on his commandments: and he will give thee a heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the river Tigris, and they lodged there.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fish leaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the young man laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart and the liver and the gall, and put them up safely.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and when they had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both went on their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, to what use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be no more vexed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they were come near to Rages,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shall lodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one only daughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may be given thee for a wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou only art of her kindred.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and I will speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we will celebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry her to another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guilty of death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertain to thee than to any other.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brother Azarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who all died in the marriage chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lest if I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wicked spirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which come unto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring my father’s and my mother’s life because of me to the grave with sorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember the precepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry a wife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; for she shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning of the evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee in marriage.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never come again any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both of you, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity on you, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee from the beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall go with thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children. Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and his heart was effectually joined to her.</p>
