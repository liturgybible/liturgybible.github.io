            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then David said: This is the house of God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he commanded to gather together all the proselytes of the land of Israel, and out of them he appointed stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David prepared in abundance iron for the nails of the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an immense weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the cedar trees were without number, which the Sidonians, and Tyrians brought to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said: Solomon my son is very young and tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the Lord, must be such as to be renowned in all countries: therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And therefore before his death he prepared all the charges.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he called for Solomon his son: and commanded him to build a house to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my desire to have built a house to the name of the Lord my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou canst not build a house to my name, after shedding so much blood before me:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be a most quiet man: for I will make him rest from all his enemies round about: and therefore he shall be called Peaceable: and I will give peace and quietness to Israel all his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He shall build a house to my name, and he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now then, my son, the Lord be with thee, and do thou prosper, and build the house to the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Lord also give thee wisdom and understanding, that thou mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the law of the Lord thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep the commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded Moses to teach Israel: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor be dismayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold I in my poverty have prepared the charges of the house of the Lord, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron there is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all account: timber also and stones I have prepared for all the charges.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most skilful in their work,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> David also charged all the princes of Israel, to help Solomon his son,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Saying: You see, that the Lord your God is with you, and hath given you rest round about, and hath delivered all your enemies into your hands, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and be- fore his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Give therefore your hearts and your souls, to seek the Lord your God: and arise, and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house, which is built to the name of the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.</p>
