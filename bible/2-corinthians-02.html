            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in part, that I may not burden you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
