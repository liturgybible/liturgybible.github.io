            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And again he began to teach by the sea side; and a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went up into a ship, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude was upon the land by the sea side.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his doctrine:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And whilst he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the birds of the air came and ate it up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And other some fell upon stony ground, where it had not much earth; and it shot up immediately, because it had no depth of earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And some fell upon good ground; and brought forth fruit that grew up, and increased and yielded, one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he was alone, the twelve that were with him asked him the parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to them: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all things are done in parables:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand: lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he saith to them: Are you ignorant of this parable? and how shall you know all parables?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He that soweth, soweth the word.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown, and as soon as they have heard, immediately Satan cometh and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And these likewise are they that are sown on the stony ground: who when they have heard the word, immediately recieve it with joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they have no root in themselves, but are only for a time: and then when tribulation and persecution ariseth for the word they are presently scandalized.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And others there are who are sown among thorns: these are they that hear the word,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts after other things entering in choke the word, and it is made fruitless.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And these are they who are sown upon the good ground, who hear the word, and receive it, and yield fruit, the one thirty, another sixty, and another a hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said to them: Doth a candle come in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be made manifest: neither was it made secret, but that it may come abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said to them: Take heed what you hear. In what measure you shall mete, it shall be measured to you again, and more shall be given to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said: So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And should sleep, and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow up whilst he knoweth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For the earth of itself bringeth forth fruit, first the blade, then the ear, afterwards the full corn in the ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he said: To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we compare it?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> It is as a grain of mustard seed: which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air may dwell under the shadow thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And with many such parables, he spoke to them the word, according as they were able to hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And without parable he did not speak unto them; but apart, he explained all things to his disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he saith to them that day, when evening was come: Let us pass over to the other side.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And sending away the multitude, they take him even as he was in the ship: and there were other ships with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was filled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow; and they awake him, and say to him: Master, doth it not concern thee that we perish?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And rising up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea: Peace, be still. And the wind ceased: and there was made a great calm.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he said to them: Why are you fearful? have you not faith yet? And they feared exceedingly: and they said one to another: Who is this (thinkest thou) that both wind and sea obey him?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The sower soweth the word.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p>
