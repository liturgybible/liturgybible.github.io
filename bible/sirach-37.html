            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Every friend saith, I am his friend also: but there is a friend, which is only a friend in name.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Is it not a grief unto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemy?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to cover the earth with deceit?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There is a companion, which rejoiceth in the prosperity of a friend, but in the time of trouble will be against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There is a companion, which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh up the buckler against the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Every counsellor extolleth counsel; but there is some that counselleth for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Beware of a counsellor, and know before what need he hath; for he will counsel for himself; lest he cast the lot upon thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And say unto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsel from such as envy thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous; neither with a coward in matters of war; nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an envious man of thankfulness; nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness; nor with the slothful for any work; nor with an hireling for a year of finishing work; nor with an idle servant of much business: hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord, whose, mind is according to thy mind, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And let the counsel of thine own heart stand: for there is no man more faithful unto thee than it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For a man’s mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an high tower.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And above all this pray to the most High, that he will direct thy way in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let reason go before every enterprize, and counsel before every action.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The countenance is a sign of changing of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Four manner of things appear: good and evil, life and death: but the tongue ruleth over them continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is unprofitable to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> There is one that sheweth wisdom in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all food.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For grace is not given, him from the Lord, because he is deprived of all wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Another is wise to himself; and the fruits of understanding are commendable in his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> A wise man instructeth his people; and the fruits of his understanding fail not.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A wise man shall be filled with blessing; and all they that see him shall count him happy.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The days of the life of man may be numbered: but the days of Israel are innumerable.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A wise man shall inherit glory among his people, and his name shall be perpetual.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> My son, prove thy soul in thy life, and see what is evil for it, and give not that unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath every soul pleasure in every thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Be not unsatiable in any dainty thing, nor too greedy upon meats:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For excess of meats bringeth sickness, and surfeiting will turn into choler.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> By surfeiting have many perished; but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life.</p>
