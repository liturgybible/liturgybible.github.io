            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Emath also in the borders thereof, and Tyre, and Sidon: for they have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Tyre hath built herself a strong hold, and heaped together silver as earth, and gold as the mire of the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Behold the Lord shall possess her, and shall strike her strength in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Ascalon shall see, and shall fear, and Gaza, and shall be very sorrowful: and Accaron, because her hope is confounded : and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be inhabited.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will encompass my house with them that serve me in war, going and returning, and the oppressor shall no more pass through them: for now I have seen with my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem: BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee, the just and saviour: he is poor, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will destroy the chariot out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow for war shall be broken: and he shall speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power shall be from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord God shall be seen over them, and his dart shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord God will sound the trumpet, and go in the whirlwind of the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord of hosts will protect them: and they shall devour, and subdue with the stones of the sling: and drinking they shall be inebriated as it were with wine, and they shall be filled as bowls, and as the horns of the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord their God will save them in that day, as the dock of his people: for holy stones shall be lifted up over his land.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</p>
