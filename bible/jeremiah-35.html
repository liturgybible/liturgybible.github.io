            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Go to the house of the Rechabites: and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers of the treasures, and thou shalt give them wine to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of Habsanias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I brought them into the house of the Lord, to the treasure house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the man of God, which was by the treasure house of the princes, above the treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they answered : We will not drink wine: because Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tents all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in which you are strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us: so as to drink no wine all our days: neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or field, or seed:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But we have dwelt in tents, and have been obedient according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up to our land, we said: Come, let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of Syria: and we have remained in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Go, and say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you not receive instruction, to obey my words, saith the Lord ?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, by which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed: and they have drunk none to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their father: but I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, and you have not obeyed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending and saying: Return ye every man from his wicked way, and make your ways good: and follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land, which I gave you and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have constantly kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them: but this people hath not obeyed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called to them, and they have not answered me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jeremias said to the house of the Rechabites: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the Cod of Israel: Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done all that he commanded you:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of host the God of Israel: There shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab the son of Rechab, standing before me for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;</p>

            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:</p>
