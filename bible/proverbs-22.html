            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A good name is better than great riches: and good favour is above silver and gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The rich and poor have met one another: the Lord is the maker of them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The prudent man saw the evil, and hid himself: the simple passed on, and suffered loss.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The fruit of humility is the fear of the Lord, riches and glory and life.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Arms and swords are in the way of the perverse: but he that keepeth his own soul departeth far from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> It is a proverb: A young man according to his way, even when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The rich ruleth over the poor: and the borrower is servant to him that lendeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that soweth iniquity shall reap evils, and with the rod of his anger he shall be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that is inclined to mercy shall be blessed: for of his bread he hath given to the poor. He that maketh presents shall purchase victory and honour: but he carrieth away the souls of the receivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Cast out the scoffer, and contention shall go out with him, and quarrels and reproaches shall cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He that loveth cleanness of heart, for the grace of his lips shall have the king for his friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge: and the words of the unjust are overthrown.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The slothful man saith: There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the midst of the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit: he whom the Lord is angry with, shall fall into it.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that oppresseth the poor, to in- crease his own riches, shall himself give to one that is richer, and shall be in need.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy heart to my doctrine :</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels, and it shall flow in thy lips:</p>

            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That I might shew thee the certainty, and the words of truth, to answer out of these to them that sent thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Do no violence to the poor, because he is poor: and do not oppress the needy in the gate:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because the Lord will judge his cause, and will afflict them that have afflicted his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Be not a friend to an angry man, and do not walk with a furious man:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Lest perhaps thou learn his ways, and take scandal to thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Be not with them that fasten down their hands, and that offer themselves sureties for debts:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For if thou have not wherewith to restore, what cause is there, that he should take the covering from thy bed?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Pass not beyond the ancient bounds which thy fathers have set.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure.</p>
