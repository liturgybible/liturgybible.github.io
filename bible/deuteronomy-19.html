            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of the land, which the Lord will give thee in possession,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Paving diligently the way: and thou shalt divide the whole province of thy land equally into three parts: that he who is forced to flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> This shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth, whose life is to be saved: He that killeth his neighbour ignorantly, and who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle struck his friend, and killed him: he shall flee to one of the cities aforesaid, and live:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed, pushed on by his grief should pursue, and apprehend him. if the way be too long, and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death, because he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore I command thee, that thou separate three cities at equal distance one from another.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders, as he swore to thy fathers, and shall give thee all the land that he promised them,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> (Yet so, if thou keep his commandments, and do the things which I command thee this day, that thou love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways at all times) thou shalt add to thee other three cities, and shalt double the number of the three cities aforesaid:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess, lest thou be guilty of blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But if any man hating his neighbour, lie in wait for his life, and rise and strike him, and he die, and he flee to one of the cities aforesaid,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The ancients of his city shall send, and take him out of the place of refuge, and shall deliver him into the hand of the kinsman of him whose blood was shed, and he shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou shalt not pity him, and thou shalt take away the guilt of innocent blood out of Israel, that it may be well with thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother, and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> That others hearing may fear, and may not dare to do such things.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> ,21Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;</p>
