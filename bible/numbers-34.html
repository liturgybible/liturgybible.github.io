            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Command the children of Israel, and then shalt say to them: When you are entered into the land of Chanaan, and it shall be fallen into your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by these limits:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin, which is by Edom: and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out to the town called Adar, and shall reach as far as Asemona.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great sea.</p>
