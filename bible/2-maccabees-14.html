            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the year one hundred and seventy-two, king Demetrius assembled has army, and went into Media to get him succours to fight against Tryphon.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Arsaces the king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius was entered within his borders, and he sent one of his princes to take him alive, and bring him to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he went and defeated the army of Demetrius: and took him, and brought him to Arsaces, and he put him into custody.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all the land of Juda was at rest all the days of Simon, and he sought the good of his nation: and his power, and his glory pleased them well all his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And with all his glory he took Joppe for a haven, and made an entrance to the isles of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he enlarged the bounds of his nation, and made himself master of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazara, and of Bethsura, and of the castle: and took away all uncleanness out of it and there was none that resisted him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And every man tilled his land with peace: and the land of Juda yielded her increase, and the trees of the fields their fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The ancient men sat all in the streets, and treated together of the good things of the land, and the young men put on them glory, and the robes of war.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he provided victuals for the cities, and he appointed that they should be furnished with ammunition, so that the fame of his glory was renowned even to the end of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with great joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And every man sat under his vine, and under his fig tree: and there was none to make them afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There was none left in the land to fight against them: kings were discomfited in those days.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he strengthened all those of his people that were brought low, and he sought the law, and took away every unjust and wicked man.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He glorified the sanctuary, and multiplied the vessels of the holy places.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, that Jonathan was dead: and they were very sorry.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But when they heard that Simon his brother was made high priest in his place, and was possessed of all the country, and the cities therein:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They wrote to him in tables of brass, to renew the friendship and alliance which they had made with Judas, and with Jonathan his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they were read before the assembly in Jerusalem. And this is the copy of the letters that the Spartans sent.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The princes and the cities of the Spartans to Simon the high priest, and to the ancients, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews their brethren, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The ambassadors that were sent to our people, have told us of your glory, and honour, and joy: and we rejoice at their coming.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And we registered what was said by them in the councils of the people in this manner: Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the son of Jason, ambassadors of the Jews, came to us to renew the former friendship with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it pleased the people to receive the men honourably, and to put a copy of their words in the public records, to be a memorial to the people of the Spartans. And we have written a copy of them to Simon the high priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And after this Simon sent Numenius to Rome, with a great shield of gold the weight of a thousand pounds, to confirm the league with them. And when the people of Rome had heard</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> These words, they said: What thanks shall we give to Simon, and his sons?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For he hath restored his brethren, and hath driven away in fight the enemies of Israel from them: and they decreed him liberty, and registered it in tables of brass, and set it upon pillars in mount Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And this is a copy of the writing: The eighteenth day of the month Elul, in the year one hundred and seventy-two, being the third year under Simon the high priest at Asaramel,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> In a great assembly of the priests, and of the people, and the princes of the nation, and the ancients of the country, these things were notified: Forasmuch as there have often been wars in our country,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Simon the son of Mathathias of the children of Jarib, and his brethren have put themselves in danger, and have resisted the enemies of their nation, for the maintenance of their holy places, and the law: and have raised their nation to great glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jonathan gathered together his nation, and was made their high priest, and he was laid to his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And their enemies desired to tread down and destroy their country, and to stretch forth their hands against their holy places.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then Simon resisted and fought for his nation, and laid out much of his money, and armed the valiant men of his nation, and gave them wages:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he fortified the cities of Judea, and Bethsura that lieth in the borders of Judea, where the armour of the enemies was before: and he placed there a garrison of Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he fortified Joppe which lieth by the sea: and Gazara, which bordereth upon Azotus, wherein the enemies dwelt before, and he placed Jews here: and furnished them with all things convenient for their reparation.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the people seeing the acts of Simon, and to what glory he meant to bring his nation, made him their prince, and high priest, because he had done all these things, and for the justice, and faith, which he kept to his nation, and for that he sought by all means to advance his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And in his days things prospered in his hands, so that the heathens were taken away out of their country, and they also that were in the city of David in Jerusalem in the castle, out of which they issued forth, and profaned all places round about the sanctuary, and did much evil to its purity.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he placed therein Jews for the defence of the country, and of the city, and he raised up the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And king Demetrius confirmed him in the high priesthood.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> According to these things he made him his friend, and glorified him with great glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For he had heard that the Romans had called the Jews their friends, and confederates, and brethren, and that they had received Simon's ambassadors with honour:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And that the Jews, and their priests, had consented that he should be their prince, and high priest for ever, till there should arise a faithful prophet:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And that he should be chief over them, and that he should have the charge of the sanctuary, and that he should appoint rulers over their works, and over the country, and over the armour, and over the strong holds.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And that he should have care of the holy places: and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all the writings in the country should be made in his name: and that he should be clothed with purple, and gold:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And that it should not be lawful for any of the people, or of the priests, to disannul any of these things, or to gainsay his words, or to call together an assembly in the country without him: or to be clothed with purple, or to wear a buckle of gold:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And whosoever shall do otherwise, or shall make void any of these things shall be punished.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And it pleased all the people to establish Simon, and to do according to these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Simon accepted thereof, and was well pleased to execute the office of the high priesthood, and to be captain, and prince of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests, and to be chief over all.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brass, and that they should be set up within the compass of the sanctuary, in a conspicuous place:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And that a copy thereof should be put in the treasury, that Simon and his sons may have it.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the son of Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with a great power and navy,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias his protector.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiled himself wilfully in the times of their mingling with the Gentiles, seeing that by no means he could save himself, nor have any more access to the holy altar,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftieth year, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and also of the boughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and so that day he held his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolish enterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, and asked how the Jews stood affected, and what they intended, he answered thereunto:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors’ honour, I mean the high priesthood, am now come hither:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of things pertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend the good of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no small misery through the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, be careful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed on every side, according to the clemency that thou readily shewest unto all.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that the state should be quiet.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king’s friends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incense Demetrius.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of the elephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent him forth,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that were with him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot the Jews to be their welfare.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor’s coming, and that the heathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him that had established his people for ever, and who always helpeth his portion with manifestation of his presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So at the commandment of the captain they removed straightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town of Dessau.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now Simon, Judas’ brother, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them that were with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fight for their country, durst not try the matter by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and the captain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and it appeared that they were all of one mind, they consented to the covenants,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: and when the day came, and stools were set for either of them,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest some treachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made a peaceable conference.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sent away the people that came flocking unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: for he love the man from his heart</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: so he married, was quiet, and took part of this life.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, and considering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state; for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to be the king’s successor.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with the accusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was much displeased with the covenants, and commanding him that he should send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste unto Antioch.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When this came to Nicanor’s hearing, he was much confounded in himself, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But because there was no dealing against the king, he watched his time to accomplish this thing by policy.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to be churlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly than he was wont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not of good, he gathered together not a few of his men, and withdrew himself from Nicanor.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented by Judas’ policy, came into the great and holy temple, and commanded the priests, that were offering their usual sacrifices, to deliver him the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when they sware that they could not tell where the man was whom he sought,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and made an oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as a prisoner, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable temple unto Bacchus.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted up their hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever a defender of their nation, saying in this manner;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this house ever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop every unrighteous mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man of very good report, who for his kindness was called a father of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> For in the former times, when they mingled not themselves with the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and did boldly jeopard his body and life with all vehemency for the religion of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto the Jews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, and violently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire should be brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every side fell upon his sword;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noble birth:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude also rushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and cast himself down manfully among the thickest of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he fell down into the midst of the void place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed out like spouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ran through the midst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out his bowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restore him those again, he thus died.</p>
