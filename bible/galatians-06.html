            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Bear ye one another's burdens; and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall have glory in himself only, and not in another.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For every one shall bear his own burden.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And let him that is instructed in the word, communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law; but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
