            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the second year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuchodonosor had a dream, and his spirit was terrified, and his dream went out of his mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then the king commanded to call together the diviners and the wise men, and the magicians, and the Chaldeans: to declare to the king his dreams: so they came and stood before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said to them: I saw a dream: and being troubled in mind I know not what I saw.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the king answering said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The king answered, and said: I know for certain that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If therefore you tell me not the dream, there is one sentence concerning you, that you have also framed a lying interpretation, and full of deceit, to speak before me till the time pass away. Tell me therefore the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then the Chaldeains answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king, neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult; nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the decree being gone forth, the wise men were slain: and Daniel and his companions were sought for, to be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Daniel inquired concerning the law and the sentence, of Arioch the general of the king's army, who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Daniel went in and desired of the king, that he would give him time to resolve the question and declare it to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he went into his house, and told the matter to Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias his companions:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To the end that they should ask mercy at the face of the God of heaven concerning this secret, and that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then was the mystery revealed to Daniel by a vision in the night: and Daniel blessed the God of heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And speaking he said: Blessed be the name of the Lord from eternity and for evermore: for wisdom and fortitude are his.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he changeth times and ages: taketh away kingdoms and establisheth them, giveth wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He revealeth deep and hidden things, and knoweth what is in darkness: and light is with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us, the king's discourse.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers can declare to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and of clay, and broke them in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's thrashingfloor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou therefore art the head of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And after thee shall rise up another kingdom, inferior to thee, of silver: and another third kingdom of brass, which shall rule over all the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the fourth kingdom shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break and destroy all these.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Arid whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But in the days of those kingdoms the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people, and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms, and itself shall stand for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> According as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces, the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And the king spoke to Daniel, and said: Verily your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things: seeing thou couldst discover this secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon, and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago over the works of the province of Babylon: but Daniel himself was in the king's palace.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</p>
