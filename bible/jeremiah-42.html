            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all the captains of the warriors, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Jezonias the son of Osaias, and the rest of the people from the least to the greatest came near:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they said to Jeremias the prophet: Let our supplication fall before thee: and pray thou for us to the Lord thy God for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as thy eyes do behold us.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let the Lord thy God shew us the way by which we may walk, and the thing that we must do.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jeremias the prophet said to them: I have heard you: behold I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words: and whatsoever thing he shall answer me, I will declare it to you: and I will hide nothing from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they said to Jeremias: The Lord be witness between us of truth and faithfulness, if we do not according to every thing for which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whether it be good or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom me send thee: that it may be well with us when we shall hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now after ten days, the word of the Lord came to Jeremias.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he called Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, to whom you sent me, to present your supplications before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If you will be quiet and remain in this land, I will build you up, and not pull you down: I will plane you, and not pluck you up: for now I am appeased for the evil that I have done to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Fear not because of the king of Babylon, of whom you are greatly afraid: fear him not, saith the Lord: for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will shew mercies to you, and will take pity on you, and will cause you to dwell in your own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But if you say: We will not dwell in this land, neither will we hearken to the voice of the Lord our God,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Saying: No, but we will go into the land of Egypt: where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor suffer hunger: and there we will dwell.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For this now hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of Juda: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to go into Egypt, and enter in to dwell there:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The sword which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt: and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall cleave to you in Egypt, and there you shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt, to dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of the evil that I will bring upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my indignation hath been kindled against the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my indignation be kindled against you, when you shall enter into Egypt, and you shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach: and you shall see this place no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> This is the word of the Lord concerning you, O ye remnant of Juda: Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have adjured you this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For you have deceived your own souls: for you sent me to the Lord our God, saying: Pray for us to the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord our God shall say to thee, so declare unto us, and we will do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And now I have declared it to you this day, and ;you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, with regard to all the things for which he hath sent me to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence in the place to which you desire to go to dwell there.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.</p>
