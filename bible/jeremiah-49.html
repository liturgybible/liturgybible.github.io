            <p data-verse="49:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities ?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill : but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to m? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care they could not rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy !</p>
            <p data-verse="49:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, rind it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonouor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asur, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Arise, and so up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from I all their confines, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="49:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the fear quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord : and will send the sword after them, till I consume them.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam, to return, saith the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="49:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?</p>

            <p data-verse="49:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
            <p data-verse="49:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</p>

            <p data-verse="49:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</p>
