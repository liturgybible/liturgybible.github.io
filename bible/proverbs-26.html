            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin.</p>
