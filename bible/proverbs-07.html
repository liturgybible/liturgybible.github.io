            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My son, keep my words, and lay up my precepts with thee. Son,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thy eye:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from the stranger who sweeteneth her words.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For I look out of the window of my house through the lattice,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who passeth through the street by the corner, and goeth nigh the way of her house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In the dark, when it grows late, in the darkness and obscurity of the night,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And behold a woman meeteth him in harlot's attire prepared to deceive souls; talkative and wandering,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent face, flattereth, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore I am come out to meet thee, desirous to see thee, and I have found thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the desired embraces, till the day appear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He took with him a bag of money: he mill return home the day of the full moon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the flattery of her lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to bonds,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now therefore, my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been slain by her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers of death.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
