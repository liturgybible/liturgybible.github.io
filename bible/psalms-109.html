            <p data-verse="109:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O God, be not thou silent in thy praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They have spoken against with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at his right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> May the userer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be blotted out.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> May they be before the lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="109:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> because he remembered not to show mercy,</p>
            <p data-verse="109:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But thou, O Lord, do with for thy names sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed for oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads,</p>
            <p data-verse="109:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Help me, O Lord my God; save me according to thy mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They will curse and thou will bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with the their confusion as with a double cloak.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors</p>

            <p data-verse="109:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>

            <p data-verse="109:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>

            <p data-verse="109:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
            <p data-verse="109:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That they may know that this is thy hand; that  thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="109:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him  from those that condemn his soul.</p>
