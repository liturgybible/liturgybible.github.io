            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the pride of Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and have marred their vine branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the army are clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in the day of his preparation, and the drivers are stupefied.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle one against another in the streets: their looks are like torches, like lightning running to and fro.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in their march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a covering shall be prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is thrown down to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen were led away mourning as doves, murmuring in their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool, but the men flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that will return back.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious furniture.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth, and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them afraid?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with rapine.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</p>
