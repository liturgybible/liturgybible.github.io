            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Achab told Jezabel all that Elias had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by this hour to morrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Elias was afraid, and rising up he went whithersoever he had a mind: and he came to Bersabee of Juda, and left his servant there,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went forward, one day's journey into the desert. And when he was there, and sat under a juniper tree, he requested for his soul that he might die, and said: It is enough for me, Lord, take away my soul: for I am no better than my fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he cast himself down, end slept in the shadow of the juniper tree: and behold an angel of the Lord touched him, and said to him: Arise and eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth cake, and a vessel of water: and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said to him: Arise, eat: for thou hast yet a great way to go.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he arose, and ate, and drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God, Horeb.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave: and behold the word of the Lord came unto him, and he said to him: What dost thou here, Elias?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he answered: With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they have thrown down thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to him: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord: and behold the Lord passeth, and a great and strong wind before the Lord over throwing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in pieces: the Lord is not in the wind, and after the wind an earthquake: the Lord is not in the earthquake.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after the earthquake a fire: the Lord is not in the fire, and after the fire a whistling of a gentle air.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and coming forth stood in the entering in of the cave, and behold a voice unto him, saying: What dost thou here, Elias? And he answered:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they have destroyed thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord said to him: Go, and return on thy way through the desert to Damascus: and when thou art come thither, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thou shalt anoint Jehu the son of Namsi to be king over Israel: and Eliseus the son of Saphat, of Abelmeula, thou shalt anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall escape the sword of Hazael, shall be slain by Jehu: and whosoever shall escape the sword of Jehu, shall be slain by Eliseus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I will leave me seven thousand men in Israel, whose knees have not been bowed before Baal, and every mouth that hath not worshipped him kissing the hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Elias departing from thence, found Eliseus the son of Saphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and he was one of them that were ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and when Elias came up to him, he cast his mantle upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he forthwith left the oxen and ran after Elias, and said: Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said to him: Go, and return back: for that which was my part, I have done to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And returning back from him, he took a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled the flesh with the plough of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and rising up he went away, and followed Elias, and ministered to him.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</p>
