            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda, Osee the son of Ela reigned in Samaria over Israel nine years.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did evil before the Lord: but not as the kings of Israel that had been before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Against him came up Salmanasar king of the Assyrians, and Osee became his servant, and paid him tribute.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the king of the Assyrians found that Osee endeavouring to rebel had sent messengers to Sua the king of Egypt, that he might not pay tribute to the king of the Assyrians, as he had done every year, he besieged him, bound him, and cast him into prison,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he went through all the land: and going up to Samaria, he besieged it three years.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the ninth year of Osee, the king of the Assyrians took Samaria, and carried Israel away to Assyria: and he placed them in Hala and Habor by the river of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they worshipped strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they walked according to the way of the nations which the Lord had destroyed in the sight of the children of Israel and of the kings of Israel: because they had done in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Israel offended the Lord their God with things that were not right: and built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they made them statues and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they burnt incense there upon altars after the manner of the nations which the Lord had removed from their face: and they did wicked things, provoking the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they worshipped abominations, concerning which the Lord had commanded them that they should not do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord testified to them in Israel and in Juda by the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying: Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts, and ceremonies, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers: and as I have sent to you in the hand of my servants the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they hearkened not, but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers, who would not obey the Lord their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they rejected his ordinances and the covenant that he made with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified against them: and they followed vanities, and acted vainly: and they followed the nations that were round about them, concerning which the Lord had commanded them that they should not do as they did.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they forsook all the precepts of the Lord their God: and made to themselves two molten calves, and groves, and adored all the host of heaven: and they served Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And consecrated their sons, and their daughters through fire: and they gave themselves to divinations, and soothsayings: and they delivered themselves up to do evil before the Lord, to provoke him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them from his sight, and there remained only the tribe of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But neither did Juda itself keep the commandments of the Lord their God: but they walked in the errors of Israel, which they had wrought.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord cast off all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, till he cast them away from his face:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Even from that time, when Israel was rent from the house of David, and made Jeroboam son of Nabat their king: for Jeroboam separated Israel from the Lord, and made them commit a great sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, which he had done: and they departed not from them,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Till the Lord removed Israel from his face, as he had spoken in the hand of all his servants the prophets: and Israel was carried away out of their land to Assyria, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king of the Assyrians brought people from Babylon, and from Cutha, and from Avah, and from Emath, and from Sepharvaim: and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it was told the king of the Assyrians, and it was said: The nations which thou hast removed, and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria, know not the ordinances of the God of the land: and the Lord hath sent lions among them: and behold they kill them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: Carry thither one of the priests whom you brought from thence captive, and let him go, and dwell with them: and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So one of the priests who had been carried away captive from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should worship the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the temples of the high places, which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities where they dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For the men of Babylon made Sochothbenoth: and the Cuthites made Nergel: and the men of Emath made Asima.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Hevites made Nebahaz and Tharthac. And they that were of Sepharvaim burnt their children in fire, to Adramelech and Anamelech the gods of Sepharvaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And nevertheless they worshipped the Lord. And they made to themselves, of the lowest of the people, priests of the high places, and they placed them in the temples of the high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when they worshipped the Lord, they served also their own gods according to the custom of the nations out of which they were brought to Samaria:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Unto this day they followed the old manner: they fear not the Lord, neither do they keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob, whom he surnamed Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> With whom he made a covenant, and charged them, saying: You shall not fear strange gods, nor shall you adore them, nor worship them, nor sacrifice to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power, and a stretched out arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you adore, and to him shall you sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe to do them always: and you shall not fear strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the covenant that he made with you, you shall not forget: neither shall ye worship strange gods,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But they did not hearken, but did according to their old custom.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> So these nations feared the Lord, but nevertheless served also their idols: their children also and grandchildren, as their fathers did, so do they unto this day.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.</p>
