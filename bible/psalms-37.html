            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A psalm for David himself. Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the evildoers shall be cut off : but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be : and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The sinner shall watch the just man : and shall gnash upon him with his teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the Lord shall laugh at him : for he foreseeth that his day shall come.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The wicked have drawn out the sword : they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Lord knoweth the days of undefiled; and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled :</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth mercy and shall give.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For such as bless him shall inherit the land : but such as curse him shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed shall be in blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints : they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom : and his tongue shall speak judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to death,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> But the Lord will not leave in his hands; nor condemn him when he shall be judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Expect the Lord and keep his way : and he will exalt thee to inherit the land : when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And I passed by, and lo, he was not : and I sought him and his place was not found.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Keep innocence, and behold justice : for there are remnants for the peaceable man.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But the unjust shall be destroyed together : the remnants of the wicked shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in the time of trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the Lord will help them and deliver them : and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him.</p>
