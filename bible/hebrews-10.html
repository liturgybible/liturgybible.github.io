            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Holocausts for sin did not please thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And a high priest over the house of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed; but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will come, and will not delay.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But my just man liveth by faith; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And having an high priest over the house of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.</p>
