            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou shalt make bars also of setim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thou shalt put them in through the rings that are in the sides of the ark, that it may be carried on them.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And in the candlestick itself shall be four cups in the manner of a nut, and at every one, bowls and lilies.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six coming forth out of one shaft.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And both the bowls and the branches shall be of the same beaten work of the purest gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thou shalt make also seven lamps, and shalt set them upon the candlestick, to give light over against.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> The snuffers also and where the snuffings shall be put out, shall be made of the purest gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> The whole weight of the candlestick with all the furniture thereof shall be a talent of the purest gold.</p>
