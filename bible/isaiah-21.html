            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A grievous vision is told me: he that is unfaithful dealeth unfaithfully : and he that is a spoiler, spoileth. Go up, O Elam, besiege, O Mede: I have made all the mourning thereof to cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore are my loins filled with pain, anguish hath taken hold of me, as the anguish of a woman in labour: I fell down at the hearing of it, I was troubled at the seeing of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My heart failed, darkness amazed me: Babylon my beloved is become a wonder to me.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For they are fled from before the swords, from the sword that hung over them, from the bent bow, from the face of a grievous battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For thus saith the Lord to me: Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Cedar shall be taken away.</p>
