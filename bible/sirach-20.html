            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There is a reproof that is not comely: again, some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It is much better to reprove, than to be angry secretly: and he that confesseth his fault shall be preserved from hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance! for so shalt thou escape wilful sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As is the lust of an eunuch to deflower a virgin; so is he that executeth judgment with violence.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There is one that keepeth silence, and is found wise: and another by much babbling becometh hateful.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Some man holdeth his tongue, because he hath not to answer: and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> A wise man will hold his tongue till he see opportunity: but a babbler and a fool will regard no time.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that useth many words shall be abhorred; and he that taketh to himself authority therein shall be hated.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> There is a sinner that hath good success in evil things; and there is a gain that turneth to loss.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth up his head from a low estate.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it sevenfold.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He giveth little, and upbraideth much; he openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he ask it again: such an one is to be hated of God and man.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The fool saith, I have no friends, I have no thank for all my good deeds, and they that eat my bread speak evil of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorn! for he knoweth not aright what it is to have; and it is all one unto him as if he had it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> An unseasonable tale will always be in the mouth of the unwise.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A wise sentence shall be rejected when it cometh out of a fool’s mouth; for he will not speak it in due season.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There is that is hindered from sinning through want: and when he taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> There is that destroyeth his own soul through bashfulness, and by accepting of persons overthroweth himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A lie is a foul blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the untaught.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> A thief is better than a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall have destruction to heritage.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is ever with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> A wise man shall promote himself to honour with his words: and he that hath understanding will please great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He that tilleth his land shall increase his heap: and he that pleaseth great men shall get pardon for iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stop up his mouth that he cannot reprove.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is hoarded up, what profit is in them both?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Better is he that hideth his folly than a man that hideth his wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Necessary patience in seeking ing the Lord is better than he that leadeth his life without a guide.</p>
