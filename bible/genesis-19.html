            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the two angels came to Sodom ii in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them, he rose up and went to meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the ground,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your servant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in the morning you shall go on your way. And they said: No, but we will abide in the street.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were come in to his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread and they ate:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house both young and old, all the people together.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the men that came in to thee at night? bring them out hither that we may know them:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> no not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I have two daughters who as yet have not known man : I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the shadow of my roof.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou camest in, said they, as a, stranger, was it to be a judge? therefore we will afflict thee more than them. 0 And they pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto them, and shut the door:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And them that were without, p they struck with blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they said to Lot: Hast thou here ally of thine? son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have his daughters, and said : Arise : get you out of this place, because the Lord will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when it was- morning, the angels pressed him, saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters which thou hast: lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they brought him forth, and set him without the city: and there they spoke to him, saying : Save thy life : look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but save thyself in the mountain, lest thou be also consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Lot said to them: I beseech thee my Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil seize me, and I die :</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a little one, and my soul shall live?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Make haste and be saved there, because I cannot do any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called Segor.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of salt.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Abraham got up early in the morning and in the place where he had stood before with the Lord, U</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein he had dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, (for he was afraid to stay in Segor,) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the elder said to the younger Our father is old, and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the whole earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder went in and lay with her father : but he perceived not neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the next day the elder said to the younger : Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> They made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the elder bore a son, and called his name Moab: he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ammon, that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the Ammonites unto this day.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ( is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</p>
