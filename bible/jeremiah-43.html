            <p data-verse="43:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end of speaking to the people all the words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, all these words:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Azarias the son of Osaias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and all the proud men, made answer, saying to Jeremias: Thou tellest a lie: the Lord our God hath not sent thee, saying: Go not into Egypt, to dwell there.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Baruch the son of Nerias setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to cause us to be carried away captives to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers took all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of all nations, to which they had before been scattered, to dwell in the land of Juda:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every soul, which Nabuzardan the general had left with Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerias.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they went Into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: and they came as far as Taphnis.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnis, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Take great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them in the vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharao's house in Taphnis: in the sight of the men of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will send, and take Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my servant: and I will set his throne over these stones which I have hid, and he shall set his throne over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt: such as are for death, to death: and such as are for captivity, to captivity: and such as are for the sword, to the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them, and he shall carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment: and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he shall break the statues of the house of the sun, that are in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</p>
            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.</p>
