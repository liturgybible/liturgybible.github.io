            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory :</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</p>

            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
