            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward the north:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands: the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites, neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims. But the Moabites call them Emims.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp, as the Lord had sworn:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And after all the fighting men were dead,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Lord spoke to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> It was accounted a land of giants: and giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappadocians: who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven: that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come to the Jordan, and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass: because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we slew him with his sons and all his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and women and children. We left nothing of them:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached not: and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</p>
