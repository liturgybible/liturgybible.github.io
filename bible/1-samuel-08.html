            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn son was Joel: and the name of the second was Abia, judges in Bersabee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled, came to Samuel to Ramatha.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: make us a king, to judge us, as all nations have.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the word was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, that they should say: Give us a king, to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day: as they have forsaken me, and served strange gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now therefore hearken to their voice: but yet testify to them, and foretell them the right of the king, that shall reign over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people that had desired a king of him,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And said: This will be the right of the king, that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and will make them his horsemen, and his running footmen to run before his chariots,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and centurions, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to make him arms and chariots.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments, and to be his cooks, and bakers.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best oliveyards, and give them to his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn, and of the revenues of your vineyards, to give his eunuchs and servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Your servants also and handmaids, and your goodliest young men, and your asses he will take away, and put them to his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Your flocks also he will tithe, and you shall be his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the king, whom you have chosen to yourselves. and the Lord will not hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and they said: Nay: but there shall be a king over us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall judge us, and go out before us, and tight our battles for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel: Let every man go to his city.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p>
