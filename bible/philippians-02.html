            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men's.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>
