            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Do therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My son, beep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The fault is not so great when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>

            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
