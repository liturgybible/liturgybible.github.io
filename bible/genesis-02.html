            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>

            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
