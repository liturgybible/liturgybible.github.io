            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by man's day; but neither do I judge my own self.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> What will you ? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</p>
