            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In that day Debbora and Barac son of Abinoem sung, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O you of Israel, that have willingly offered your lives to danger, bless the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hear, O ye kings, give ear, ye princes: It is I, it is I, that will sing to the Lord, I will sing to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, and passedst by the regions of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The mountains melted before the face of the Lord, and Sinai before the face of the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the days of Samgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jahel the paths rested: and they that went by them, walked through by-ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The valiant men ceased, and rested in Israel: until Debbora arose, a mother arose in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord chose new wars, and he himself overthrew the gates of the enemies: a shield and spear was not seen among forty thousand of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My heart loveth the princes of Israel: O you that of your own good will offered yourselves to danger, bless the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Speak, you that ride upon fair asses, and you that sit in judgment, and walk in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Where the chariots were dashed together, and the army of the enemies was choked, there let the justices of the Lord be rehearsed, and his clemency towards the brave men of Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the gates, and obtained the sovereignty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Arise, arise, O Debbora, arise, arise, and utter a canticle. Arise, Barac, and take hold of thy captives, O son of Abinoem.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The remnants of the people are saved, the Lord hath fought among the valiant ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec, and after him out of Benjamin into thy people, O Amalec: Out of Machir there came down princes, and out of Zabulon they that led the army to fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The captains of Issachar were with Debbora, and followed the steps of Barac, who exposed himself to danger, as one going headlong, and into a pit. Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Why dwellest thou between two borders, that thou mayest hear the bleatings of the flocks? Ruben being divided against himself, there was found a strife of courageous men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Galaad rested beyond the Jordan, and Dan applied himself to ships: Aser dwelt on the sea shore, and abode in the havens.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But Zabulon and Nephtali offered their lives to death in the region of Merome.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanach by the waters of Mageddo, and yet they took no spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> War from heaven was made against them, the stars remaining in their order and courses fought against Sisara.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The torrent of Cison dragged their carcasses, the torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Cisoii: tread thou, my soul, upon the strong ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the stoutest of the enemies fled amain, and fell headlong down.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the angel of the Lord: curse the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to help his most valiant men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Blessed among women be Jahel the wife of Haber the Cinite, and blessed be she in her tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He asked her water and she gave him milk, and offered him butter in a dish fit for princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> She put her left hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer, and she struck Sisara, seeking in his head a place for the wound, and strongly piercing through his temples.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> At her feet he fell: he fainted, and he died: he rolled before her feet, and he lay lifeless and wretched.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so slow?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> One that was wiser than the rest of his wives, returned this answer to her mother in law:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of different kinds is heaped together to adorn the necks.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his rising.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the land rested for forty years.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.</p>
