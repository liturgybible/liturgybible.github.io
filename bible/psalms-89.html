            <p data-verse="89:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever. I will shew forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou hast said: Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens: thy truth shall be prepared in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I have made a covenant with my elect: I have sworn to David my servant:</p>

            <p data-verse="89:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord: or who among the sons of God shall be like to God?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints: great and terrible above all them that are about him.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth: the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> the north and the sea thou hast created. Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> thy arm is with might. Let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne. Mercy and truth shall go before thy face:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation. They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted.</p>

            <p data-verse="89:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst: I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have anointed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen him.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The enemy shall have no advantage over him: nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I will cut down his enemies before his face; and them that hate him I will put to flight.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I will set his hand in the sea; and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and the support of my salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> I will keep my mercy for him for ever: and my covenant faithful to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And I will make his seed to endure for evermore: and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If they profane my justices: and keep not my commandments:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I will visit their iniquities with a rod: and their sins with stripes.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But my mercy I will not take away from him: nor will I suffer my truth to fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> his seed shall endure for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with thy anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not assisted him in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him with confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger burn like fire?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Remember what my substance is for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have held in my bosom) of many nations:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it. So be it.</p>
