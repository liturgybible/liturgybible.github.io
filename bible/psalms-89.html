            <p data-verse="89:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou rulest the power of the sea: and appeasest the motion of the waves thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain: with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.</p>

            <p data-verse="89:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="89:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And if his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments:</p>

            <p data-verse="89:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Neither will I profane my covenant: and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> his seed shall endure for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And his throne as the sun before me: and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry with thy anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his strength fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him: thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Thou hast turned away the help of his sword; and hast not assisted him in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou hast made his purification to cease: and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Thou hast shortened the days of his time: thou hast covered him with confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="89:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end? shall thy anger burn like fire?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Remember what my substance is for hast thou made all the children of men in vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Who is the man that shall live, and not see death: that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Lord, where are thy ancient mercies, according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth?</p>
            <p data-verse="89:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants (which I have held in my bosom) of many nations:</p>
            <p data-verse="89:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.</p>
