            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and our God turned the curse into blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to Tobias.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the priests.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts of the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I commanded and they cleansed the storehouses: and I brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, the sacrifice, and the frankincense.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and they that ministered were fled away every man to his own country:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them together, and I made them to stand in their places.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil into the storehouses.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God and his ceremonies.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children of Juda in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates, and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares, stayed without Jerusalem once or twice.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day: for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to the language of this and that people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: m and yet women of other countries brought even him to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange women?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his ministry :</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</p>
