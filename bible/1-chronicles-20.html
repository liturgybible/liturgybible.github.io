            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass after the course of a year, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the children of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the spoils of the city which were very great.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people that were therein he brought out: and made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them, so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon : and he returned with alibis people to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> After this there arose a war at Gazer against the Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the race of Raphaim, and humbled them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Another battle also was fought against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> There was another battle also in Geth, in which there was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the stock of Rapha.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his servants.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
