            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which as we have said above is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their power had gone through every people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants, and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews for fear of Mardochai:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power: and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men's mouths.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them, repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the ten sons of Aman the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews, to do to morrow in Susan as they have done to day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> ,15And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar the Jews gathered themselves together, and they killed in Susan three hundred men: but they took not their substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Moreover through all the provinces which were subject to the king's dominion the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were Billed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now the thirteenth day of the month Adar was the first day with them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holy day, so that all times hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And therefore they appointed that day to be a holy day of feasting and gladness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But those Jews that dwelt in towns not walled and in villages, appointed the fourteenth day of the month Adar for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions of their banquets and meats.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters to the Jews that abode in all the king's provinces, both those that lay near and those afar off,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> ,21That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month Adar for holy days, and always at the return of the year should celebrate them with solemn honour:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Because on those days the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies, and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which they should send one to another portions of meats; and should give gifts to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Jews undertook to observe with solemnity all they had begun to do at that time, which Mardochai by letters had commanded to be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy and adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them and destroy them: and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And afterwards Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his endeavours might be made void by the king's letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And since that time these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots: because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this epistle, that is, of this book:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed, the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years continually succeed one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai the Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence this day should be established a festival for the time to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace, and receive truth,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves and by their seed, fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And all things which are contained in the history of this book, which is called Esther.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof; and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</p>
