            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to me: Fear him not: because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also the king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed them,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, be- sides innumerable towns that had no walls.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: from the torrent Amen unto the mount Hermon,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants. His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man's hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of d Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> To Machir also I gave Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And to the tribes of Ruben and Cad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Amen, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I commanded Josue also at that time, saying: Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the king- dome to which thou shalt pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> ( Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ( for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.</p>
