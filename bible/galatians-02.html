            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> (For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</p>
