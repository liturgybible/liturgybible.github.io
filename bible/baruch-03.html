            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let thy indignation towards us cease: for it is better for us to live and serve Nabuchodonosor the great king, and be subject to thee, than to die and to perish, or suffer the miseries of slavery.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> All our cities and our possessions, all mountains and hills, and fields, and herds of oxen, and flocks of cheep, and goats, and horses, and camels, and all our goods, and families are in thy sight:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let all we have be subject to thy law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Both we and our children are thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Come to us a peaceable lord, and use our service as it shall please thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then he came down from the mountains with horsemen, in great power, and made himself master of every city, and all the inhabitants of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And from all the cities he took auxiliaries valiant men, and chosen for war.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And so great a fear lay upon all those provinces, that the inhabitants of all the cities, both princes and nobles, as well as the people, went out to meet him at his coming.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And received him with garlands, and lights, and dances, and tumbrels, and flutes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And though they did these things, they could not for all that mitigate the fierceness of his heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For he both destroyed their cities and cut down their groves.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For Nabuchodonosor the king had commanded him to destroy all the gods of the earth, that he only might be called God by those nations which could be brought under him by the power of Holofernes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he had passed through all Syria Sobal, and all Apamea, and all Mesopotamia, he came to the Idumeans into the land of Gabaa,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he took possession of their cities, and stayed there for thirty days, in which days he commanded all the troops of his army to be united.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, crieth unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; ar thou art merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned before thee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God: for the which cause these plagues cleave unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think upon thy power and thy name now at this time.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will we praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hast scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> How happeneth it Israel, that thou art in thine enemies’ land, that thou art waxen old in a strange country, that thou art defiled with the dead,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldest have dwelled in peace for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Young men have seen light, and dwelt upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that way.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> It hath not been heard of in Chanaan, neither hath it been seen in Theman.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession!</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But he that knoweth all things knoweth her, and hath found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore hath filled it with fourfooted beasts:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth, calleth it again, and it obeyeth him with fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when he calleth them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness they shewed light unto him that made them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him</p>
            <p data-verse="3:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men.</p>
