            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he made Eliakim his brother king in his stead, over Juda and Jerusalem: and he turned his name to Joakim: but he took Joachaz with him, and carried him away into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did evil before the Lord his God.</p>
