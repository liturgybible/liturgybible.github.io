            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass on the second first sabbath, that as he went through the corn fields, his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And some of the Pharisees said to them: Why do you that which is not lawful on the sabbath days?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jesus answering them, said: Have you not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they that were with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the bread of proposition, and gave to them that were with him, which is not lawful to eat but only for the priests?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught. And there was a man, whose right hand was withered.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he knew their thoughts; and said to the man who had the withered hand: Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And rising he stood forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Jesus said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And looking round about on them all, he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they were filled with madness; and they talked one with another, what they might do to Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples; and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles):</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Simon, whom he surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alpheus, and Simon who is called Zelotes,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jude, the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Who were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were cured.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him, and healed all.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for you shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for you shall laugh.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be glad in that day and rejoice; for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For according to these things did their fathers to the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But woe to you that are rich: for you have your consolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Woe to you that are filled: for you shall hunger. Woe to you that now laugh: for you shall mourn and weep.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Woe to you when men shall bless you: for according to these things did their fathers to the false prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But I say to you that hear: Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Bless them that curse you, and pray for them that calumniate you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And to him that striketh thee on the one cheek, offer also the other. And him that taketh away from thee thy cloak, forbid not to take thy coat also.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Give to every one that asketh thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also love those that love them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also do this.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks are to you? for sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But love ye your enemies: do good, and lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Give, and it shall be given to you: good measure and pressed down and shaken together and running over shall they give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he spoke also to them a similitude: Can the blind lead the blind? do they not both fall into the ditch?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> The disciple is not above his master: but every one shall be perfect, if he be as his master.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And why seest thou the mote in thy brother's eye: but the beam that is in thy own eye thou considerest not?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Or how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother's eye.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For there is no good tree that bringeth forth evil fruit; nor an evil tree that bringeth forth good fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> For every tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns; nor from a bramble bush do they gather the grape.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And why call you me, Lord, Lord; and do not the things which I say?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Every one that cometh to me, and heareth my words, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> He is like to a man building a house, who digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a rock. And when a flood came, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and it could not shake it; for it was founded on a rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> But he that heareth, and doth not, is like to a man building his house upon the earth without a foundation: against which the stream beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</p>

            <p data-verse="6:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</p>

            <p data-verse="6:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</p>
