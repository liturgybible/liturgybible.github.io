            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he made to it a crown of gold round about,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers' breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches going out from one shaft.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He made also the altar of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate and the sides, and the horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.</p>
