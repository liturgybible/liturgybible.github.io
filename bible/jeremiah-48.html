            <p data-verse="48:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Moab is destroyed: proclaim a cry for her little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping: for in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Flee, save your lives: and be as heath in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken:</p>
            <p data-verse="48:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out: and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully: and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity : therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in battle?</p>
            <p data-verse="48:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities: and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Comfort him, all you that are round about him, and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod?</p>
            <p data-verse="48:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon: because the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What Is done?</p>
            <p data-verse="48:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Amen, that Moab is wasted.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And judgment is come upon the plain country: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the Lord: and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab: and be ye Iike the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the highest place.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I know, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes: and my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there shall be haircloth.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning: because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded ! And Moab shall be a derision, and an example to all round about him.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Moab shall cease to be a people : because he hath gloried against the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon: but there came a fire out of Kesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Seen, and it shall devour part of Moab. and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of Chamos: for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken captives.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.</p>

            <p data-verse="48:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</p>

            <p data-verse="48:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</p>
