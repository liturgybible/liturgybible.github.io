            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him, saying: Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that recieved the didrachmas, came to Peter and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children, or of strangers?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</p>
