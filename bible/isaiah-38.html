            <p data-verse="38:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In those days Ezechias was sick even to death, and Isaias the son of Amos the prophet came unto him, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Ezechias turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Ezechias wept with great weeping.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the word of the Lord came to Isaias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Go and say to Ezechias: Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears: behold I will add to thy days fifteen years:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect it.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And this shall be a sign to thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this word which he hath spoken:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold I will bring again the shadow of the lines, by which it is now gone down in the sun dial of Achaz with the sun, ten lines backward. And the sun returned ten lines by the degrees by which it was gone down.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The writing of Ezechias king of Juda, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I said: In the midst of my days I shall go to the gates of hell: I sought for the residue of my years.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more, nor the inhabitant of rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, as a shepherd's tent. My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he out me off: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I hoped till morning, as a lion so hath he broken all my bones: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove: my eyes are weakened looking upward: Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it? I will recount to thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> O Lord, if man's life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter: but thou best delivered my soul that it should not perish, thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as I do this day: the father shall make thy truth known to the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> O Lord, save me, and we will sing our psalms all the days of our life in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now Isaias had ordered that they should take a lump of figs, and lay it as it plaster upon the wound, and that he should be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Ezechias bed said: What shah be the sign that I shah go up to the house of the Lord?</p>

            <p data-verse="38:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</p>
