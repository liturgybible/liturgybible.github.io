            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass about a month after this that Naas, the Ammonite came up, and began to fight against Jabes Galaad. And all the men of Jabes said to Naas: Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Naas the Ammonite answered them: On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may pluck out all your right eyes, and make you a reproach in all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the ancients of Jabes said to him: Allow us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and if there be no one to defend us, we will come out to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of Saul: and they spoke these words in the hearing of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And behold Saul came, following oxen out of the field, and he said: What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the words of the men of Jabes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the spirit of the Lord came upon Saul, when he had heard these words, and his anger was exceedingly kindled.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And taking both the oxen, he cut them in pieces, and sent them into all the coasts of Israel by messengers, saying: Whosoever shall not come forth, and follow Saul and Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people, and they went out as one man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he numbered them in Bezec: and there were of the children of Israel three hundred thousand: and of the men of Juda thirty thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said to the messengers that came: Thus shall you say to the men of Jabes Galaad: Tomorrow, when the sun shall be hot, you shall have relief. The messengers therefore came, and told the men of Jabes: and they were glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they said: In the morning we will come out to you: and you shall do what you please with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, when the morrow was come that Saul put the people in three companies: and he came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and he slew the Ammonites until the day grew hot, and the rest were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the people said to Samuel: Who is he that said: Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men and we will kill them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Saul said: No man shall be killed this day, because the Lord this day hath wrought salvation in Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Samuel said to the people: Come and let us go to Galgal, and let us renew the kingdom there.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And all the people went to Galgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Galgal, and they sacrificed there victims of peace before the Lord. And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</p>
