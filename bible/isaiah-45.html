            <p data-verse="45:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will go before thee, and will humble the great ones of the earth: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and will burst the bars of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will give thee hidden treasures, and the concealed riches of secret places: that thou mayest know that I am the Lord who call thee by thy name, the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have made a likeness of thee, and thou hast not known me.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I am the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God, besides me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That they may know who are from the rising of the sun, and they who are from the west, that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none else:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I form the light, and create darkness, I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord that do all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Drop down dew, ye heavens, from above, and let the clouds rain the just: let the earth be opened, and bud forth a saviour: and let justice spring up together: I the Lord have created him.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Woe to him that gainsayeth his maker, a sherd of the earthen pots: shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it: What art thou making, and thy work is without hands?</p>
            <p data-verse="45:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Woe to him that saith to his father: Why begettest thou? and to the woman: Why dost thou bring forth?</p>
            <p data-verse="45:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus saith the Lord the Holy One of Israel, his maker: Ask me of things to come, concerning my children, and concerning the work of my hands give ye charge to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I made the earth: and I created man upon it: my hand stretched forth the heavens, and I have commanded all their host.</p>

            <p data-verse="45:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thus saith the Lord: The labour of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of Sabaim, men of stature shall come over to thee, and shall be thins: they shall walk after thee, they shall go bound with manacles: and they shall worship thee, and shall make supplication to thee: only in thee is God, and there is no God besides thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Verily thou art a hidden God, the God of Israel the saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They are all confounded and ashamed: the forgers of errors are gone together into confusion.</p>

            <p data-verse="45:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob: Seek me in vain. I am the Lord that speak justice, that declare right things.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Assemble yourselves, and come, and draw near together, ye that are saved of the Gentiles: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven work, and pray to a god that cannot save.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Tell ye, and come, and consult together: who hath declared this from the beginning, who hath foretold this from that time? Have not I the Lord, and there is no God else besides me? A just God and a saviour, there is none besides me.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Be converted to me, and you shall be saved, all ye ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is no other.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I have sworn by myself, the word of justice shall go out of my mouth, and shall not return:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For every knee shall be bowed to me, and every tongue shall swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Therefore shall he say: In the Lord are my justices and empire: they shall come to him, and all that resist him shall be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified and praised.</p>
