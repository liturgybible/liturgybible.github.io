            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when David and his men were come to Siceleg on the third day, the Amalecites had made an invasion on the south side upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And had taken the women captives that were in it, both little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had carried them with them, and went on their way.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So when David and his men came to the city, and found it burnt with fire, and that their wives and their sons, and their daughters were taken captives,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voices, and wept till they had no more tears.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the two wives also of David were taken captives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David was greatly afflicted: for the people had a mind to stone him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved for his sons, and daughters: but David took courage in the Lord his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech: Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some being weary stayed there.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed, who being weary could not go over the torrent Besor.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten them his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water three days, and three nights.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong? or whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite, and my master left me, because I began to be sick three days ago.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? And he said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to this company. And David swore to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey, and the spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next day, and there escaped not a man of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken: David recovered all.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before him: and they said: This is the prey of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And David came to the two hundred men, who being weary had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people saluted them peaceably.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then all the wicked and unjust men that had gone with David answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man take his wife and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And no man shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal shall be the portion of him that went down to battle and of him that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made a statute, and an ordinance, and as a law in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then David came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey to the ancients of Juda his neighbours, saying: Receive a blessing of the prey of the enemies of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> To them that were in Bethel, and that were in Ramoth to the south, and to them that were in Jether,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And to them that were in Aroer and that were in Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And that were in Rachal, and that were in the cities of Jerameel, and that were in the cities of Ceni,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And that were in Arama, and that were in the lake Asan, and that were in Athach,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And that were in Hebron, and to the rest that were in those places, in which David had abode with his men.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.</p>
