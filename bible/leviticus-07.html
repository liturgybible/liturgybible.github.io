            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This also is the law of the sacrifice for a trespass, it is most holy:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore where the holocaust is immolated, the victim also for a trespass shall be slain: the blood thereof shall be poured round about the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They shall offer thereof the rump and the fat that covereth the entrails:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The two little kidneys, and the fat which is by the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little kidneys.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the burnt sacrifice of the Lord for a trespass.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Every male of the priestly race, shall eat this flesh in a holy place, because it is most holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As the sacrifice for sin is offered, so is also that for a trespass: the same shall be the law of both these sacrifices: it shall belong to the priest that offereth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The priest that offereth the victim of holocaust, shall have the skin thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And every sacrifice of flour that is baked in the oven, and whatsoever is dressed on the gridiron, or in the fryingpan, shall be the priest's that offereth it:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Whether they be tempered with oil, or dry, all the sons of Aaron shall have one as much as another.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that is offered to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If the oblation be for thanksgiving, they shall offer leaves without leaven tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and fine flour fried, and cakes tempered and mingled with oil:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Moreover leaves of leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanks, which is offered for peace offerings:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Of which one shall be offered to the Lord for firstfruits, and shall be the priest's that shall pour out the blood of the victim.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the flesh of it shall be eaten the same day, neither shall any of it remain until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If any man by vow, or of his own accord offer a sacrifice, it shall in like manner be eaten the same day: and if any of it remain until the morrow, it is lawful to eat it:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But whatsoever shall be found on the third day shall be consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If any man eat of the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on the third day, the oblation shall be of no effect, neither shall it profit the offerer: yea rather whatsoever soul shall defile itself with such meat, shall be guilty of transgression.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The flesh that hath touched any unclean thing, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire: he that is clean shall eat of it.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Say to the children of Israel: The fat of a sheep, and of an ox, and of a goat you shall not eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The fat of a carcass that hath died of itself, and of a beast that was caught by another beast, you shall have for divers uses.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If any man eat the fat that should be offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord, he shall perish out of his people.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Every one that eateth blood, shall perish from among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He that offereth a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, let him offer therewith a sacrifice also, that is, the libations thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim, and the breast: and when he hath offered and consecrated both to the Lord, he shall deliver them to the priest,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who shall burn the fat upon the altar, but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The right shoulder also of the victims of peace offerings shall fall to the priest for firstfruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood, and the fat, he shall have the right shoulder also for his portion.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For the breast that is elevated and the shoulder that is separated I have taken of the children of Israel, from off their victims of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a law for ever, from all the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> This is the anointing of Aaron and his sons, in the ceremonies of the Lord, in the day when Moses offered them, that they might do the office of priesthood,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the things that the Lord commanded to be given them by the children of Israel, by a perpetual observance in their generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> This is the law of holocaust, and of the sacrifice for sin, and for trespass, and for consecration, and the victims of peace offerings:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Which the Lord appointed to Moses in mount Sinai, when he commanded the children of Israel, that they should offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,</p>

            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.</p>
