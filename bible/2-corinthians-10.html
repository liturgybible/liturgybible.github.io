            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent, am bold toward you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present, with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some, who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And every height that exhalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ's, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we also.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> (For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the gospel, not to glory in another man's rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</p>
