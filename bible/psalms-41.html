            <p data-verse="41:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor : the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord preserve him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth : and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The Lord help him on his bed of sorrow : thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I said: O Lord, be thou merciful to me : heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My enemies have spoken evils against me: when shall he die and his name perish?</p>
            <p data-verse="41:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things : his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke to the same purpose.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All my enemies whispered together against me : they devised evils to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They determined against me an unjust word : shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?</p>
            <p data-verse="41:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For even the man of peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again : and I will requite them.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me : because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence : and hast established me in thy sight for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Blessed by the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.</p>
