            <p data-verse="41:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They determined against me an unjust word : shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?</p>
            <p data-verse="41:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For even the man of peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me.</p>
