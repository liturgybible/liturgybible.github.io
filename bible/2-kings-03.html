            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joram the son of Achab reigned over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of m Josaphat king of Juda. And he reigned twelve years.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did evil before the Lord, but not like his father and his mother: for he took away the statues of Baal, which his father had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Nevertheless he stuck to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he depart from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now Mesa, king of Moab, nourished many sheep, and he paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams with their fleeces.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Achab was dead, he broke the league which he had made with the king of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And king Joram went out that day from Samaria, and mustered all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying: The king of Moab is revolted from me, come with me against him to battle. And he answered: I will come up: he that is mine, is thine: my people, thy people: and my horses, thy horses.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said: Which way shall we go up? But he answered: By the desert of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So the king of Israel, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom went, and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey, and there was no water for the army, and for the beasts, that followed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king of Israel said: Alas, alas, alas, the Lord hath gathered us three kings together, to deliver us into the hands of Moab!</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may beseech the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered: Here is Eliseus the son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Josaphat said: The word of the Lord is with him. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom went down to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Eliseus said to the king of Israel: What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him: Why hath the Lord gathered together these three kings, to deliver them into the hands of Moab?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Eliseus said to him: As the Lord of hosts liveth, in whose sight I stand, if I did not reverence the face of Josaphat king of Juda, I would not have hearkened to thee, nor looked on thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But now bring me hither a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he said:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the Lord: Make the channel of this torrent full of ditches.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For thus saith the Lord: You shall not see wind, nor rain: and yet this channel shall be filled with waters, and you shall drink, you and your families, and your beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And this is a small thing in the sight of the Lord: moreover he will deliver also Moab into your hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And you shall destroy every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall cut down every fruitful tree, and shall stop up all the springs of waters, and every goodly field you shall cover with stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifices used to be offered, that behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all the Moabites hearing that the kings were come up to fight against them, gathered together all that were girded with a belt upon them, and stood in the borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they rose early in the morning, and the sun being now up, and shining upon the waters, the Moabites saw the waters over against them red, like blood,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they said: It is the blood of the sword: the kings have fought among themselves, and they have killed one another: go now, Moab, to the spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they went into the camp of Israel: but Israel rising up defeated Moab, who fled before them. And they being conquerors, went and smote Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they destroyed the cities: and they filled every goodly field, every man casting his stone: and they stopt up all the springs of waters: and cut down all the trees that bore fruit, so that brick walls only remained: and the city was beset by the slingers, and a great part thereof destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when the king of Moab saw this, to wit, that the enemies had prevailed, he took with him seven hundred men that drew the sword, to break in upon the king of Edom: but they could not.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall: and there was great indignation in Israel, and presently they departed from him, and returned into their own country.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</p>
