            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, and have testified.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any man's.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
