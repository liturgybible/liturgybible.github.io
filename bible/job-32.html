            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were his elders that were speaking.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said : I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered : but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Lest you should say : We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken : they stood, and answered no more :</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my lips, and will answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</p>

            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</p>
