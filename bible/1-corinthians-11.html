            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord's supper.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>
