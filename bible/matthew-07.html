            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</p>

            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</p>
