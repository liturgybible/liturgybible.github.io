            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his commandments and precepts, which I command thee, and thy sons, and thy grandsons, all the days of thy life, that thy days may be prolonged.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hear, O Israel, and observe to do the things which the Lord hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst be greatly multiplied, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and rising.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors of thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and shall have given thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Houses full of riches, which thou didst not set up, cisterns which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards, which thou didst not plant,</p>

            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst him in the place of temptation.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances, and should fear the Lord our God, that it might be well with us all the days of our life, as it is at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he will be merciful to us, if we keep and do all his precepts before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</p>
