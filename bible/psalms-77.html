            <p data-verse="77:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted:</p>
            <p data-verse="77:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the eternal years.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more favourable again?</p>
            <p data-verse="77:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation?</p>
            <p data-verse="77:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger shut up his mercies?</p>
            <p data-verse="77:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the right hand of the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I will meditate on all thy works: and will be employed in thy inventions.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great God like our God?</p>
            <p data-verse="77:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy power known among the nations:</p>
            <p data-verse="77:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> with thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people the children of Jacob and of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a sound. For thy arrows pass:</p>
            <p data-verse="77:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> the voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy footsteps shall not be known.</p>
            <p data-verse="77:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron</p>
