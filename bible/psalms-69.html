            <p data-verse="69:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for David.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I stick fast in the mire of the deep: and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not away.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are not hidden from thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="69:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For God will save Sion, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in  an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or  bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>

            <p data-verse="69:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="69:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>
