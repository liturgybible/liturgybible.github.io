            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto mount Olivet, then Jesus sent two disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Saying to them: Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them and bring them to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And if any man shall say anything to you, say ye, that the Lord hath need of them: and forthwith he will let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Tell ye the daughter of Sion: Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of her that is used to the yoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the disciples going, did as Jesus commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they brought the ass and the colt, and laid their garments upon them, and made him sit thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way: and others cut boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the multitudes that went before and that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he was come into Jerusalem, the whole city was moved, saying: Who is this?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the people said: This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the chairs of them that sold doves:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he saith to them: It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there came to him the blind and the lame in the temple; and he healed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying: Hosanna to the son of David; were moved with indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And said to him: Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said to them: Yea, have you never read: Out of the mouth of infants and of sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And leaving them, he went out of the city into Bethania, and remained there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And in the morning, returning into the city, he was hungry.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And seeing a certain fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves only, and he saith to it: May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the fig tree withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the disciples seeing it wondered, saying: How is it presently withered away?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Jesus answering, said to them: Amen, I say to you, if you shall have faith, and stagger not, not only this of the fig tree shall you do, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Take up and cast thyself into the sea, it shall be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And in all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when he was come into the temple, there came to him, as he was teaching, the chief priests and ancients of the people, saying: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Jesus answering, said to them: I also will ask you one word, which if you shall tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If we shall say, from heaven, he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we shall say, from men, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held John as a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And answering Jesus, they said: We know not. He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he answering, said: I will not. But afterwards, being moved with repentance, he went.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And coming to the other, he said in like manner. And he answering, said: I go, Sir; and he went not.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Which of the two did the father's will? They say to him: The first. Jesus saith to them: Amen I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots shall go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For John came to you in the way of justice, and you did not believe him. But the publicans and the harlots believed him: but you, seeing it, did not even afterwards repent, that you might believe him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> They say to him: He will bring those evil men to an evil end; and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, that shall render him the fruit in due season.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Jesus saith to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? By the Lord this has been done; and it is wonderful in our eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they knew that he spoke of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And seeking to lay hands on him, they feared the multitudes: because they held him as a prophet.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>
