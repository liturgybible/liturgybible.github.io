            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I would not have set with the dogs of my flock:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and they were thought unworthy of life itself.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of junipers was their food.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when they had found any of them, they ran to them with a cry.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They dwelt in the desert places of torrents, and in caves of earth, or upon the gravel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and counted it delightful to be under the briers.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The children of foolish and base men, and not appearing at all upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now I am turned into their song, and am become their byword.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid to spit in my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and hath put a bridle into my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with their paths as with waves.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to help.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken, and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my miseries.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a cloud.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And now my soul fadeth within myself, and the days of affliction possess me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they that feed upon me, do not sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and they have girded me about, as with the collar of my coat.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and thou dost not regard me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the hardness of thy hand thou art against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house is appointed for every one that liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt save.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my soul had compassion on the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I expected good things, and evils are come upon me: I waited for light, and darkness broke out.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of affliction have prevented me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried in the crowd.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> I was the brother of dragons, and companion of ostriches.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried up with heat.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>
