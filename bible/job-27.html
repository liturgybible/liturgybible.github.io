            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked one.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and I will not conceal it.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without cause?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his grandsons shall not be filled with bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If he shall heap together silver as earth, and prepare raiment as clay,</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with it: and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper he hath made a booth.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him: he shall open his eyes and find nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Poverty like water shall take hold on him, a tempest shall oppress him in the night.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a whirlwind shall snatch him from his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare: out of his hand he would willingly flee.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss at him, beholding his place.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</p>

            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
