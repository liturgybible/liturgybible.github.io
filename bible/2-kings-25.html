            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, he and all his army against Jerusalem: and they surrounded it: end raised works round about it.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the city was shut up and besieged till the eleventh year of king Sedecias,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The ninth day of the month: and a famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And a breach was made into the city: and all the men of war fled in the night between the two walls by the king's garden, (now the Chaldees besieged the city round about,) and Sedecias fled by the way that leadeth to the plains of the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all the warriors that were with him were scattered, and left him:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, and he gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In the fifth month, the seventh day of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan commander of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every house he burnt with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the commander of the troops, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Nabuzardan the commander of the army, carried away the rest of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But of the poor of the land he left some dressers of vines and husbandmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the pillars of brass that were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldees broke in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They took away also the pots of brass, and the mazers, and the forks, and the cups, and the mortars, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moreover also the censers, and the bowls, such as were of gold in gold, and such as were of silver in silver, the general of the army took away.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That is, two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made in the temple of the Lord: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> One pillar was eighteen cubits high, and the chapiter of brass which was upon it was three cubits high: and the network, and the pomegranates that were upon the chapiter of the pillar, were all of brass: and the second pillar had the like adorning.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the general of the army took Seraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and three doorkeepers.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And out of the city one eunuch, who was captain over the men of war: and five men of them that had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher the captain of the army who exercised the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore men of the common people, who were found in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> These Nabuzardan the general of the army took away, and carried them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Reblatha in the land of Emath: so Juda was carried away out of their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But over the people that remained in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had left, he gave the government to Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when all the captains of the soldiers had heard this, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias governor, they came to Godolias to Maspha, Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Saraia the son of Thanehumeth the Netophathite, and Jezonias the son of Maachathi, they and their men.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying : Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: stay in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismael the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the seed royal came, and ten men with him: and smote Godolias so that he died: and also the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him in Maspha.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And all the people both little and great, and the captains of the soldiers, rising up went to Egypt, fearing the Chaldees.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda out of prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he spoke kindly to him: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he changed his garments which he had in prison, and he ate bread always before him, all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he appointed him a continual allowance, which was also given him by the king day by day, all the days of his life.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;</p>
