            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For unto us also it hath been declared, in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time, as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
