            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they glorified God in me.</p>
