            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered the Lord, and said :</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear, and I will speak : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite : My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before my, as my servant Job hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust : and my servant Job shall pray for you : his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you : for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house : and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of fold.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>
