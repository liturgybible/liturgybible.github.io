            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And they told David, saying: Behold the Philistines fight against Ceila, and they rob the barns.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go, and thou shalt smite the Philistines, and shalt save Ceila.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the men that were with David, said to him: Behold we are in fear here in Judea, how much more if we go to Ceila against the hands of the Philistines?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore David consulted the Lord again. And he answered and said to him: Arise, and go to Ceila: for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> David therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter of them: and David saved the inhabitants of Ceila.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now at that time, when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David to Ceila, he came down having an ephod with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being come into a city, that hath gates and bars.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila, and to besiege David, and his men.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now when David understood, that Saul secretly prepared evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest: Bring hither the ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David said: O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath heard a report, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy the city for my sake:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands? and will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant. And the Lord said: He will come down.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me, and my men, into the hands of Saul? And the Lord said: They will deliver thee up.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose, and departing from Ceila, wandered up and down uncertain where they should stay: and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila, and had escaped: wherefore he forbore to go out.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he remained in a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life. And David was in the desert of Ziph, in a wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jonathan the son of Saul arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hands in God: and he said to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Fear not: for the hand of my father Saul shall not find thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee, yea, and my father knoweth this.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the wood: but Jonathan returned to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gabaa, saying: Lo, doth not David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in mount Hachila, which is on the right hand of the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come down: and it shall be our business to deliver him into the king's hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Saul said: Blessed be ye of the Lord, for you have pitied my case.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Go therefore, I pray you, and use all diligence, and curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Consider and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is bid, and return to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may go with you. And if be should even go down into the earth to hide himself, I will search him out in all the thousands of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul: and David and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the plain at the right hand of Jesimon.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told David, and forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and his men were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his men encompassed David and his men round about to take them.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And a messenger came to Saul, saying: Make haste to come, for the Philistines have poured in themselves upon the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Wherefore Saul returned, leaving the pursuit of David, and went to meet the Philistines. For this cause they called that place, the Rock of division.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David’s men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jonathan Saul’s son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.</p>
