            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Abia slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight of his God, and he destroyed the altars of foreign worship, and the high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And broke the statues, and cut down the groves.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he commanded Juda to seek the Lord the God of their fathers, and to do the law, and all the commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he took away out of all the cities of Juda the altars, and temples, and reigned in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He built also strong cities in Juda, for he was quiet, and there had no wars risen in his time, the Lord giving peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to Juda: Let us build these cities, and compass them with walls, and fortify them with towers, and gates, and bars, while all is quiet from wars, because we have sought the Lord the God of our fathers, and he hath given us peace round about. So they built, and there was no hinderance in building.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Asa had in his army of men that bore shields and spears of Juda three hundred thousand, and of Benjamin that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these were most valiant men.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Zara the Ethiopian came out against them with his army of ten hundred thousand men, and with three hundred chariots: and he came as far as Maresa.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array for battle in the vale of Sephata, which is near Maresa:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he called upon the Lord God, and said: O Lord, there is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in thy name, we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our God, let not man prevail against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Juda: and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerara: and the Ethiopians fell even to utter destruction, for the Lord slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a great fear was come upon all men: and they pillaged the cities, and carried off much booty.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to Jerusalem.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
