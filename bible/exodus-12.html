            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first in the months of the year.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to eat the lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of one year: according to which rite also you shall take a kid.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice it in the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they shall take of the blood thereof, and put it upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire: you shall eat the head with the feet and entrails thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thus you shall eat it: you shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat in haste: for it is the Phase (that is the Passage) of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and will kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the houses where you shall be: and I shall see the blood, and shall pass over you: and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I shall strike the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And this day shall be for a memorial to you: and you shall keep it a feast to the Lord in your generations with an everlasting observance.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread: in the first day there shall be no leaven in your houses: whosoever shall eat any thing leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall perish out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The first day shall be holy and solemn, and the seventh day shall be kept with the like solemnity: you shall do no work in them, except those things that belong to eating.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And you shall observe the feast of the unleavened bread: for in this same day I will bring forth your army out of the land of Egypt, and you shall keep this day in your generations by a perpetual observance.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The first month, the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the same month in the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Seven days there shall not be found any leaven in your houses: he that shall eat leavened bread, his soul shall perish out of the assembly of Israel, whether he be a stranger or born in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> You shall not eat any thing leavened: in all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses called all the ancients of the children of Israel, and said to them: Go take a lamb by your families, and sacrifice the Phase.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that is at the door, and sprinkle the transom of the door therewith, and both the door cheeks: let none of you go out of the door of his house till morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the Lord will pass through striking the Egyptians: and when he shall see the blood on the transom, and on both the posts, he will pass over the door of the house, and not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses and to hurt you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy children for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when you have entered into the land which the Lord will give you as he hath promised, you shall observe these ceremonies.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when your children shall say to you: What is the meaning of this service?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> You shall say to them: It is the victim of the passage of the Lord, when he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, striking the Egyptians, and saving our houses. And the people bowing themselves, adored.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the children of Israel going forth did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass at midnight, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharao, who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive woman that was in the prison, and all the firstborn of cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Pharao arose in the night, and all his servants, and all Egypt: for there was not a house wherein there lay not one dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Pharao calling Moses and Aaron, in the night, said: Arise and go forth from among my people, you and the children of Israel: go, sacrifice to the Lord as you say.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you demanded, and departing, bless me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the Egyptians pressed the people to go forth out of the land speedily, saying: We shall all die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The people therefore took dough before it was leavened: and tying it in their cloaks, put it on their shoulders.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the children of Israel did as Moses had commanded: and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver and gold, and very much raiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them: and they stripped the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse to Socoth, being about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And a mixed multitude without number went up also with them, sheep and herds and beasts of divers kinds, exceeding many.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they baked the meal, which a little before they had brought out of Egypt, in dough: and they made earth cakes unleavened: for it could not be leavened, the Egyptians pressing them to depart, and not suffering them to make any stay: neither did they think of preparing any meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the abode of the children of Israel that they made in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Which being expired, the same day all the army of the Lord went forth out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> This is the observable night of the Lord, when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the service of the Phase: No foreigner shall eat of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so shall eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> The stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house, neither shall you break a bone thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> All the assembly of the children of Israel shall keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you, and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the manner: and he shall be as he that is born in the land: but if any man be uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> The same law shall be to him that is born in the land, and to the proselyte that sojourneth with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And the same day the Lord brought forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p>
