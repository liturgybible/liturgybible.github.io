            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Which shall be celebrated in this order. He to whom any thing is owing from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again, because it is the year of remission of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it: of thy countryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there shall be no poor nor beggar among you: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep all things that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he will bless thee, as he hath promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt borrow of no man. Thou shalt have dominion over very many nations, and no one shall have dominion over thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within the gates of thy city in the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, come to poverty: thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But shalt open it to the poor man, thou shalt lend him, that which thou perceivest he hath need of.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee, and thou say in thy heart: The seventh year of remission draweth nigh; and thou turn away thy eyes from thy poor brother, denying to lend him that which he asketh: lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it become a sin unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But thou shalt give to him: neither shalt thou do any thing craftily in relieving his necessities: that the Lord thy God may bless thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation: therefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor brother, that liveth in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When thy brother a Hebrew man, or Hebrew woman is sold to thee, and hath served thee six years, in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But shalt give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy barnfloor, and thy winepress, wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God made thee free, and therefore I now command thee this.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But if he say: I will not depart: because he loveth thee, and thy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever: thou shalt do in like manner to thy womanservant also.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them tree: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a hireling: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that thou dost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex. Thou shalt not work with the firstling of a bullock, and thou shalt not shear the firstlings of thy sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year, in the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any part disfigured or feeble, it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city: the clean and the unclean shall eat them alike, as the roe and as the hart.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood, but pour it out on the earth as water.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD’S release.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.</p>
