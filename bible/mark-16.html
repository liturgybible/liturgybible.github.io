            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, the sun being now risen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But they going forth preached every where: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
