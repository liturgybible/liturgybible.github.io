            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and another Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacharias, and Mosollam, chief men: and Joiarib, and Elnathan, wise men.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For I was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen, to defend us from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our God is upon all them that seek him in goodness: and his power and strength, and wrath upon all them that forsake him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And we fasted, and besought our God for this: and it fell out prosperously unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sarabias, and Hasabias, and with them ten of their brethren,</p>

            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I said to them: You are the holy ones of the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the Lord the God of our fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Watch ye and beep them, till you deliver them by weight before the chief of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold, and the vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> According to the number and weight of every thing: and all the weight was written at that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy- seven lambs, and twelve he goats for sin: all for a holocaust to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And they gave the king's edicts to the lords that were from the king's court, and the governors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the house of God.</p>
