            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth to war, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel, and they spoiled the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabba: but David remained in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the mean time it happened that David arose from his bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and he saw from the roof of his house a woman washing herself, over against him: and the woman was very beautiful.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king sent, and inquired who the woman was. And it was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Urias the Hethite.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him, and he slept with her: and presently she was purified from her uncleanness:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And she returned to her house having conceived. And she sent and told David, and said: I have conceived.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David sent to Joab, saying: Send me Urias the Hethite. And Joab sent Urias to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Urias came to David. And David asked how Joab did, and the people, and how the war was carried on.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said to Urias: Go into thy house, and wash thy feet. And Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out after him a mess of meat from the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not to his house. And David said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Urias said to David: The ark of God and Israel and Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and to morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place where he knew the bravest men were.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the Hethite was killed also.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the words of the battle to the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above off the wall?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant Urias the Hethite is also slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the wall above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And David said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee: for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword: encourage thy warriors against The city, and exhort them that thou mayest overthrow it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p>
