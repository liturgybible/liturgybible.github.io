            <p data-verse="52:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Shake thyself from the dust, arise, sit up, O Jerusalem: loose the bonds from off thy neck, O captive daughter of Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the Lord: You were sold gratis, and you shall be redeemed without money.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the Lord God: My people went down into Egypt at the beginning to sojourn there: and the Assyrian hath oppressed them without any cause at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And now what have I here, saith the Lord: for my people is taken away gratis. They that rule over them treat them unjustly, saith the Lord, and my name is continually blasphemed all the day long.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore my people shall know my name in that day: for I myself that spoke, behold I am here.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: of him that sheweth forth good, that preacheth salvation, that saith to Sion: Thy God shall reign!</p>
            <p data-verse="52:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The voice of thy watchmen: they have lifted up their voice, they shah praise together: for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall convert Sion</p>
            <p data-verse="52:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Rejoice, and give praise together, O ye deserts of Jerusalem: for the Lord hath comforted his people: he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p>

            <p data-verse="52:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>
