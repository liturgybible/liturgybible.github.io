            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass afterwards, that he travelled through the cities and towns, preaching and evangelizing the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary who is called Magdalen, out of whom seven devils were gone forth,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joanna the wife of Chusa, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered unto him of their substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when a very great multitude was gathered together, and hastened out of the cities unto him, he spoke by a similitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And other some fell upon a rock: and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And other some fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up with it, choked it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And other some fell upon good ground; and being sprung up, yielded fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things, he cried out: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they by the way side are they that hear; then the devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they should be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now they upon the rock, are they who when they hear, receive the word with joy: and these have no roots; for they believe for a while, and in time of temptation, they fall away.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And that which fell among thorns, are they who have heard, and going their way, are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and yield no fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But that on the good ground, are they who in a good and perfect heart, hearing the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit in patience.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now no man lighting a candle covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they who come in may see the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For there is not any thing secret that shall not be made manifest, nor hidden, that shall not be known and come abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Take heed therefore how you hear. For whosoever hath, to him shall be given: and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath, shall be taken away from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And his mother and brethren came unto him; and they could not come at him for the crowd.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it was told him: Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who answering, said to them: My mother and my brethren are they who hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a little ship with his disciples, and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when they were sailing, he slept; and there came down a storm of wind upon the lake, and they were filled, and were in danger.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they came and awaked him, saying: Master, we perish. But he arising, rebuked the wind and the rage of the water; and it ceased, and there was a calm.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he said to them: Where is your faith? Who being afraid, wondered, saying one to another: Who is this, (think you), that he commandeth both the winds and the sea, and they obey him?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they sailed to the country of the Gerasens, which is over against Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man who had a devil now a very long time, and he wore no clothes, neither did he abide in a house, but in the sepulchres.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when he saw Jesus, he fell down before him; and crying out with a loud voice, he said: What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the most high God? I beseech thee, do not torment me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man. For many times it seized him, and he was bound with chains, and kept in fetters; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The devils therefore went out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were stifled.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Which when they that fed them saw done, they fled away, and told it in the city and in the villages.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they went out to see what was done; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at his feet, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And they also that had seen, told them how he had been healed from the legion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear. And he, going up into the ship, returned back again.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Now the man, out of whom the devils were departed, besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Return to thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And it came to pass, that when Jesus was returned, the multitude received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, beseeching him that he would come into his house:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> For he had an only daughter, almost twelve years old, and she was dying. And it happened as he went, that he was thronged by the multitudes.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had bestowed all her substance on physicians, and could not be healed by any.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> She came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and immediately the issue of her blood stopped.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, Peter and they that were with him said: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee, and dost thou say, Who touched me?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Jesus said: Somebody hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And the woman seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down before his feet, and declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go thy way in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> As he was yet speaking, there cometh one to the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him: Thy daughter is dead, trouble him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And Jesus hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not; believe only, and she shall be safe.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And when he was come to the house, he suffered not any man to go in with him, but Peter and James and John, and the father and mother of the maiden.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And all wept and mourned for her. But he said: Weep not; the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> But he taking her by the hand, cried out, saying: Maid, arise.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And he bid them give her to eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And her parents were astonished, whom he charged to tell no man what was done.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
