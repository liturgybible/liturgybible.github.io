            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And a man shall be as when one is hid from the wind, and hideth himself from a storm, as rivers of waters in drought, and the shadow of a rock that standeth out in a desert land.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken diligently.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the heart of fools shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of stammerers shall speak readily and plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The fool shall no more be called prince: neither shall the deceitful be called great:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the fool will speak foolish things, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and speak to the Lord deceitfully, and to make empty the soul of the hungry, and take away drink from the thirsty.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The vessels of the deceitful are most wicked: for he hath framed devices to destroy the meek, with lying words, when the poor man speaketh judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the prince will devise such things as are worthy of a prince, and he shah stand above the rulers.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Rise up, ye rich women, and hear my voice: ye confident daughters, give ear to my speech.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For after days and a year, you that are confident shall be troubled: for the vintage is at an end, the gathering shall come no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Be astonished, ye rich women, be troubled, ye confident ones: strip yen, and be confounded, gird your loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Mourn for your breasts, for the delightful country, for the fruitful vineyard.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Upon the land of my people shall thorns and briers come up: how much more upon all the houses of joy, of the city that rejoiced?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the house is forsaken, the multitude of the city is left, darkness and obscurity are come upon its dens for ever. A joy of wild asses, the pastures of docks,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high: and the desert shall be se a charmel, and charmel shall be counted for a forest.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall sit in charmel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the work of justice shall be peace, and the service of justice quietness, and security for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.</p>

            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.</p>
