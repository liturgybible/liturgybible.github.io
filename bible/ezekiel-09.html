            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer's inkhorn at his loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem: and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and women: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men who mere before the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to them: Defile the house, and ill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the slaughter being ended I was left: and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer’s inkhorn by his side;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.</p>
