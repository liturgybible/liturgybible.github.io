            <p data-verse="29:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now all the troops of the Philistines were gathered together to Aphec: and Israel also camped by the fountain which is in Jezrahel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the lords of the Philistines marched with their hundreds and their thousands: but David and his men were in the rear with Achis.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the princes of the Philistines: Do you not know David, who was the servant of Saul the king of Israel, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me until this day?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him, and they said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place, which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our heads?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances, saying: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Achis called David, and said to him: As the Lord liveth, thou art upright and good in my sight: and so is thy going out, and thy coming in with me in the army: and I have not found my evil in thee, since the day that thou camest to me unto this day: but thou pleasest not the lords.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the eyes of the princes of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said to Achis: But what have I done, and what hast thou found in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in thy sight until this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Achis answering said to David: I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: but the princes of the Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and it shall begin to be light, go on your way.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So David and his men arose in the night, that they might set forward in the morning, and returned to the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrahel.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</p>
