            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his friends.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled at every cry.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his follies.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and diet.</p>
