            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to them that make wicked laws: and when they write, write injustice:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the cause of the humble of my people: that widows might be their prey, and that they might rob the fatherless.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> What will you do in the day of visitation, and of the calamity which cometh from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That you be not bowed down under the bond, and fall with the slain? In all these things his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Woe to the Assyrian, he is the rod and the staff of my anger, and my indignation is in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I will send him to a deceitful nation, and I will give him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take away the spoils, and to lay hold on the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But he shall not take it so, and his heart shall not think so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For he shall say:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Are not my princes as so many kings ? is not Calano as Charcamis: and Emath as Arphad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As my hand hath found the king- dome of the idol, so also their idols of Jerusalem, and of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it shall come to pass, that when the Lord shall have performed all his works in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of the haughtiness of his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he hath said: By the strength of my own hand I have done it, and by my own wisdom I have understood: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have taken the spoils of the princes, and as a mighty man hath pulled down them that sat on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And my hand hath found the strength of the people as a nest; and as eggs are gathered, that are left, so have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or made the least noise.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it? or shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn? as if a rod should lift itself up against him that lifteth it up, and a staff exalt itself, which is but wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore the sovereign Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones: and under his glory shall be kindled a burning, as it were the burning of a fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and the Holy One thereof as a flame: and his thorns and his briers shall be set on fire, and shall be devoured in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the glory of his forest, and of his beautiful hill, shall be consumed from the soul even to the flesh, and he shall run away through fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they that remain of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that they shall easily be numbered, and a child shall write them down.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and they that shall escape of the house of Jacob, shall lean no more upon him that striketh them: but they shall lean upon the Lord the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The remnant shall be converted, the remnant, I say, of Jacob, to the mighty God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For if thy people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be converted, the consumption abridged shall overflow with justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, and an abridgment in the midst of all the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of hosts: O my people that dwellest in Sion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall strike thee with his rod, and he shall lift up his staff over thee in the way of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For yet a little and a very little while, and my indignation shall cease, and my wrath shall be upon their wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the Lord of hosts shall raise up a scourge against him, according to the slaughter of Madian in the rock of Oreb, and his rod over the sea, and he shall lift it up in the way of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall putrify at the presence of the oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He shall come into Aiath, he shall pass into Magron: at Machmas he shall lay up his carriages.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> They have passed in haste, Gaba is our lodging: Rama was astonished, Gabaath of Saul fled away.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim, attend, O Laisa, poor Anathoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Medemena is removed: ye inhabitants of Gabim, take courage.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> It is yet day enough, to remain in Nobe: he shall shake his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Sion, the hill of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall break the earthen vessel with terror, and the tall of stature shall be cut down, and the lofty shall be humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the thickets of the forest shall be cut down with iron, and Libanus with its high ones shall fall.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</p>
