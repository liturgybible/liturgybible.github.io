            <p data-verse="46:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Jesus the son a Nave was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of Moses in prophecies, who according to his name was made great for the saving of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of the enemies that rose up against them, that he might set Israel in their inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How great glory gat he, when he did lift up his hands, and stretched out his sword against the cities!</p>
            <p data-verse="46:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himself brought his enemies unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Did not the sun go back by his means? and was not one day as long as two?</p>
            <p data-verse="46:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He called upon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressed upon him on every side; and the great Lord heard him.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And with hailstones of mighty power he made the battle to fall violently upon the nations, and in the descent of Beth-horon he destroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all their strength, because he fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followed the Mighty One.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the time of Moses also he did a work of mercy, he and Caleb the son of Jephunne, in that they withstood the congregation, and withheld the people from sin, and appeased the wicked murmuring.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserved to bring them in to the heritage, even unto the land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord gave strength also unto Caleb, which remained with him unto his old age: so that he entered upon the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an heritage:</p>
            <p data-verse="46:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And concerning the judges, every one by name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let the name of them that were honoured be continued upon their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord, established a kingdom, and anointed princes over his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, and the Lord had respect unto Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By his faithfulness he was found a true prophet, and by his word he was known to be faithful in vision.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He called upon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed upon him on every side, when he offered the sucking lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes cf the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And before his long sleep he made protestations in the sight of the Lord and his anointed, I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a shoe: and no man did accuse him.</p>
            <p data-verse="46:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the king his end, and lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.</p>
