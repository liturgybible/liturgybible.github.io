            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A labouring man that A is given to drunkenness shall not be rich: and he that contemneth small things shall fall by little and little.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that can rule his tongue shall live without strife; and he that hateth babbling shall have less evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Rehearse not unto another that which is told unto thee, and thou shalt fare never the worse.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other men’s lives; and if thou canst without offence, reveal them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he heard and observed thee, and when time cometh he will hate thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> A fool travaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As an arrow that sticketh in a man’s thigh, so is a word within a fool’s belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, and believe not every tale.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There is one that slippeth in his speech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The fear of the Lord is the first step to be accepted of him, and wisdom obtaineth his love.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the doctrine of life: and they that do things that please him shall receive the fruit of the tree of immortality.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The fear of the Lord is all wisdom; and in all wisdom is the performance of the law, and the knowledge of his omnipotency.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> There is a wickedness, and the same an abomination; and there is a fool wanting in wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He that hath small understanding, and feareth God, is better than one that hath much wisdom, and transgresseth the law of the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will do evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> A man may be known by his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> A man’s attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is.</p>
