            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> That night the king passed without sleep, and he commanded the histories and chronicles of former times to be brought him. And when they were reading them before him,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> They came to that place where it was written, how Mardochai had discovered the treason of Bagathan and Thares the eunuchs, who sought to kill king Assuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the king heard this, he said: What honour and reward hath Mardochai received for this fidelity? His servants and ministers said to him: He hath received no reward at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king said immediately: Who is in the court? for Aman was coming in to the inner court of the king's house, to speak to the king, that he might order Mardochai to be hanged upon the gibbet which was prepared for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The servants answered: Aman standeth in the court, and the king said: Let him come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when he was come in, he said to him: What ought to be done to the man whom the king is desirous to honour? But Aman thinking in his heart, and supposing that the king would honour no other but himself,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Answered: The man whom the king desireth to honour,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Ought to be clothed with the king's apparel, and to be set upon the horse that the king rideth upon, and to have the royal crown upon his head,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And let the first of the king's princes and nobles hold his horse, and going through the street of the city, proclaim before him and say: Thus shall he be honoured, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king said to him: Make haste and take the robe and the horse, and do as thou hast spoken to Mardochai the Jew, who sitteth before the gates of the palace. Beware thou pass over any of those things which thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arraying Mardochai in the street of the city, and setting him on the horse, went before him, and proclaimed: This honour is he worthy of, whom the king hath a mind to honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But Mardochai returned to the palace gate: and Aman made haste to go to his house, mourning and having his head covered:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he told Zares his wife, and his friends, all that had befallen him. And the wise men whom he had in counsel, and his wife answered him: If Mardochai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou canst not resist him, but thou shalt fall in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As they were yet speaking, the king's eunuchs came, and compelled him to go quickly to the banquet which the queen had prepared.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king’s house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king’s gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Mordecai came again to the king’s gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And while they were yet talking with him, came the king’s chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
