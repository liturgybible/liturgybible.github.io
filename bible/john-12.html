            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> (Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
