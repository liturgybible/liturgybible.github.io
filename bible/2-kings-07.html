            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Eliseus said: Hear ye the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord: To morrow about this time a bushel of fine hour shall be sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the man of God, said: If the Lord should make hood-gates in heaven, can that possibly be which thou sayest? And he said: Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another: What mean we to stay here till we die?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will remain here, we must also die: come, therefore, and let us run over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we shall live: but if they kill us, we shall but die.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp, And when they were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army, and they said one to another: Behold the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hethites, and of the Egyptians, and they are come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of good tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go and tell it in the king's court.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying: We went to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents standing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within the king's palace.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he arose in the night and said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying: When they come out of the city we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed,) and let us send and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the Syrians, saying: Go, and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they went after them as far as the Jordan: and behold all the way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their fright, and the messengers returned end told the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people going out pillaged the camp of the Syrians: and a bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass according to the word of the man of God, which he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very time to morrow in the gate of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When that lord answered the mall of' God, and said: Although the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which thou sayest? And he said to him: Thou shalt see with thy eyes, and shalt not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And so it fell out to him as it was foretold, and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he called the porters; and they told it to the king’s house within.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.</p>
