            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sactification in the fear of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Receive us. We have injured no man, we have corrupted no man, we have overreached no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that I did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And his bowels are more abundantly towards you; remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you have received him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .</p>
