            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when he had finished all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capharnaum.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the servant of a certain centurion, who was dear to him, being sick, was ready to die.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he had heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the ancients of the Jews, desiring him to come and heal his servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him earnestly, saying to him: He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he loveth our nation; and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent his friends to him, saying: Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For which cause neither did I think myself worthy to come to thee; but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For I also am a man subject to authority, having under me soldiers: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Which Jesus hearing, marvelled: and turning about to the multitude that followed him, he said: Amen I say to you, I have not found so great faith, not even in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they who were sent, being returned to the house, found the servant whole who had been sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass afterwards, that he went into a city that is called Naim; and there went with him his disciples, and a great multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow: and a great multitude of the city was with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whom when the Lord had seen, being moved with mercy towards her, he said to her: Weep not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he came near and touched the bier. And they that carried it, stood still. And he said: Young man, I say to thee, arise.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he that was dead, sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And there came a fear on them all: and they glorified God, saying: A great prophet is risen up among us: and, God hath visited his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judea, and throughout all the country round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And John's disciples told him of all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And John called to him two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when the men were come unto him, they said: John the Baptist hath sent us to thee, saying: Art thou he that art to come; or look we for another?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> (And in that same hour, he cured many of their diseases, and hurts, and evil spirits: and to many that were blind he gave sight.)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And answering, he said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen: the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, to the poor the gospel is preached:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And blessed is he whosoever shall not be scandalized in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the multitudes concerning John. What went ye out into the desert to see? a reed shaken with the wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But what went you out to see? a man clothed in soft garments? Behold they that are in costly apparel and live delicately, are in the houses of kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But what went you out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> This is he of whom it is written: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For I say to you: Amongst those that are born of women, there is not a greater prophet that John the Baptist. But he that is the lesser in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And all the people hearing, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with John's baptism.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the Pharisees and the lawyers despised the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord said: Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> They are like to children sitting in the marketplace, and speaking one to another, and saying: We have piped to you, and you have not danced: we have mourned, and you have not wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and you say: He hath a devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The Son of man is come eating and drinking: and you say: Behold a man that is a glutton and a drinker of wine, a friend of publicans and sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And wisdom is justified by all her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And one of the Pharisees desired him to eat with him. And he went into the house of the Pharisee, and sat down to meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And behold a woman that was in the city, a sinner, when she knew that he sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And standing behind at his feet, she began to wash his feet, with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the Pharisee, who had invited him, seeing it, spoke within himself, saying: This man, if he were a prophet, would know surely who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Jesus answering, said to him: Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. But he said: Master, say it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> A certain creditor had two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And whereas they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both. Which therefore of the two loveth him most?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Simon answering, said: I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said to him: Thou hast judged rightly.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon: Dost thou see this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she with tears hath washed my feet, and with her hairs hath wiped them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou gavest me no kiss; but she, since she came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> My head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she with ointment hath anointed my feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Wherefore I say to thee: Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much. But to whom less is forgiven, he loveth less.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And he said to her: Thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves: Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And he said to the woman: Thy faith hath made thee safe, go in peace.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>

            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>

            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
