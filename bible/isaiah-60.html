            <p data-verse="60:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For behold darkness shall cover the earth, and a mist the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness of thy rising.</p>

            <p data-verse="60:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then shalt thou see, and abound, and thy heart shall wonder and be enlarged, when the multitude of the sea shall be converted to thee, the. strength of the Gentiles shall come to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Madian and Epha: all they from Saba shall come, bringing gold and frankincense: and shewing forth praise to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the flocks of Cedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nabaioth shall minister to thee: they shall be offered upon my acceptable altar, and I will glorify the house of my majesty.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who are these, that fly as clouds, and as doves to their windows?</p>
            <p data-verse="60:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For, the islands wait for me, and the ships of the sea in the beginning: that I may bring thy sons from afar: their silver, and their gold with them, to the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the children of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister to thee: for in my wrath have I struck thee, and in my reconciliation have I had mercy upon thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="60:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Because thou wast forsaken, and hated, and there was none that passed through thee, I will make thee to be an everlasting glory, a joy unto generation and generation:</p>

            <p data-verse="60:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Iniquity shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction in thy borders, and salvation shall possess thy walls, and praise thy gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou shalt no more have the sun for thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light, and thy God for thy glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thy sun shall go down no more, and thy moon shall not decrease: for the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thy people shall be all just, they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hand to glorify me.</p>
            <p data-verse="60:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The least shall become a thousand, and a little one a most strong nation: I the Lord will suddenly do this thing in its time.</p>
