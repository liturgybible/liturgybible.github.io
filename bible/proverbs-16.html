            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It is the part of man to prepare the soul: and of the Lord to govern the tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> All the ways of a man are open to his eyes: the Lord is the weigher of spirits.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Lay open thy works to the Lord: and thy thoughts shall be directed.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The Lord hath made all things for himself: the wicked also for the evil day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice; and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death : and the wise man will pacify it.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In the cheerfulness of the king's countenance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The learned in word shall find good things: and he that trusteth in the Lord is blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and he that is sweet in words shall attain to greater things.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it: the instruction of fools is foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth: and shall add grace to his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Well ordered words are as a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> There is a way that seemeth to a man right: and the ends thereof lead to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The soul of him that laboureth, laboureth for himself, because his mouth hath obliged him to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The wicked man diggeth evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A perverse man stirreth up quarrels: and one full of words separateth princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> An unjust man allureth his friend: and leadeth him into a way that is not good</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He that with fixed eyes deviseth  wicked things, biting his lips, bringeth: evil to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord.</p>
