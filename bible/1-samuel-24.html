            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds of Engaddi.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, they told him, saying: Behold, David is in the desert of Engaddi.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Saul therefore took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went out to seek after David, and his men, even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he came to the sheepcotes, which were in his way. And there was a cave, into which Saul went, to ease nature: now David and his men lay hid in the inner part of the cave.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the servants of David said to him: Behold the day, of which the Lord said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. Then David arose, and secretly cut off the hem of Saul's robe.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> After which David's heart struck him, because he had cut off the hem of Saul's robe.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to his men: The Lord be merciful unto me, that I may do no such thing to my master the Lord's anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David stopped his men with his words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rising up out of the cave, went on his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David also rose up after him: and going out of the cave cried after Saul, saying: My lord the king. And Saul looked behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground, worshipped,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men that say David seeketh thy hurt?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the Lord hath delivered thee into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put out my hand against my lord, because he is the Lord's anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Moreover see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand, that when I cut, off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no evil in my hand, nor iniquity, neither have I sinned against thee: but thou liest in wait for my life, to take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord revenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As also it is said in the old proverb: From the wicked shall wickedness come forth: therefore my hand shall not be upon thee. After whom dost thou come out, O king of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Be the Lord judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and judge my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, Saul said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said to David: Thou art more just than I: for thou hast done good to me, and I have rewarded thee with evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And thou hast shewn this day what good things thou hast done to me: how the Lord delivered me into thy hand, and thou hast not killed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go well away? But the Lord reward thee for this good turn, for what thou hast done to me this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and have the kingdom of Israel in thy hand:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, nor take away my name from the house of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And David swore to Saul. So Saul went home: and David and his men went up into safer places.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD’S anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</p>
