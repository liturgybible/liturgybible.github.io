            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy eyes from the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the Boor in his want.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to give to him that is in distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy back.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great man.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with mildness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and as a husband to their mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch for her, shall embrace her sweetness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one: and God loveth them that love her.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his generation shall be in assurance.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first she chooseth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she try him by her laws, and trust his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to him, and give him joy,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him treasures of knowledge and understanding of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and grace.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy soul a lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in her beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the lie of thy ignorance.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not thyself to every man for sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not strive against the stream of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy works.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy household, and oppressing them that are under thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and shut when thou shouldst give.</p>
