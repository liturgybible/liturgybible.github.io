            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made all things with thy word,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which thou hast made,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And order the world according to equity and righteousness, and execute judgment with an upright heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me not from among thy children:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feeble person, and of a short time, and too young for the understanding of judgment and laws.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For though a man be never so perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount, and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance of the holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptable in thy sight, and right in thy commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I may know what is pleasing unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shall lead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father’s seat.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of the Lord is?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us: but the things that are in heaven who hath searched out?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, and send thy Holy Spirit from above?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For so the ways of them which lived on the earth were reformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing unto thee, and were saved through wisdom.</p>
