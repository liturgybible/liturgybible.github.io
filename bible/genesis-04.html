            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother’s keeper?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
