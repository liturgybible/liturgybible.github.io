            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:73"><span class="verse-num">73</span> And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:74"><span class="verse-num">74</span> Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:75"><span class="verse-num">75</span> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:73"><span class="verse-num">73</span> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:74"><span class="verse-num">74</span> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:75"><span class="verse-num">75</span> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
