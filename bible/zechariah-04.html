            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the angel that spoke in me came again: and he waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it: and seven funnels for the lights that were upon the top thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And two olive trees over it: one upon the right side of the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying: What are these things, my lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me: Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said: No, my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he answered, and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying: Not with an army, nor by might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For who hath despised little days? and they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I answered, and said to him: What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I answered again, and said to him: What are the two olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels of gold?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he spoke to me, saying: Knowest thou not what these are? And I said: No, my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said: These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord of the whole earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</p>
