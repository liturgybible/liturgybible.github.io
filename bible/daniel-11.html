            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And from the first year of Darius the Mede I stood up that he might be strengthened and confirmed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And now I will shew thee the truth. Behold there shall stand yet three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall be enriched exceedingly above them all: and when he shall be grown mighty by his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But there shall rise up a strong king, and shall rule with great power: and he shall do what he pleaseth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he shall come to his height, his kingdom shall be broken, and it shall be divided towards the four winds of the heaven: but not to his posterity, nor according to his power with which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be rent in pieces, even for strangers, beside these.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the king of the south shall be strengthened, and one of his princes shall prevail over him, and he shall rule with great power: for his dominion shall be great.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And after the end of years they shall be in league together: and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make friendship, but she shall not obtain the strength of the arm, neither shall her seed stand: and she shall be given up, and her young men that brought her, and they that strengthened her in these times.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And a plant of the bud of her roots, shall stand up: and he shall come with an army, and shall enter into the province of the king of the north: and he shall abuse them, and shall prevail.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he shall also carry away captive into Egypt their gods, and their graven things, and their precious vessels of gold and silver: he shall prevail against the king of the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the king of the south shall enter into the kingdom, and shall return to his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And his sons shall be provoked, and they shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and he shall come with haste like a flood: and he shall return and be stirred up, and he shall join battle with his forces.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king of the south being provoked shall go forth, and shall fight against the king of the north, and shall prepare an exceeding great multitude, and a multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he shall take a multitude, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many thousands: but he shall not prevail.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For the king of the north shall return and shall prepare a multitude much greater than before: and in the end of times and years, be shall come in haste with a great army, and much riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the south, and the children of prevaricators of thy people shall lift up themselves to fulfil the vision, and they shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king of the north shall come, and shall cast up a mount, and shall take the best fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, and his chosen ones shall rise up to resist, and they shall not have strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he shall come upon him and do according to his pleasure, and there shall be none to stand against his face: and he shall stand in the glorious land, and it shall be consumed by his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he shall set his face to come to possess all his kingdom, and he shall make upright conditions with him: and he shall give him a daughter of women, to overthrow it: and she shall not stand, neither shall she be for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many: and he shall cause the prince of his reproach to cease, and his reproach shall be turned upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he shall turn his face to the empire of his own land, and he shall stumble, and fall, and shall not be found.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there shall stand up in his place, one most vile, and unworthy of kingly honour: and in a few days he shall be destroyed, not in rage nor in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And there shall stand up in his place one despised, and the kingly honour shall not be given him: and he shall come privately, and shall obtain the kingdom by fraud.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the arms of the fighter shall be overcome before his face, and shall be broken; yea also the prince of the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And after friendships, he will deal deceitfully with him: and he shall go up, and shall overcome with a small people.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he shall enter into rich and plentiful cities: and he shall do that which his fathers never did, nor his fathers' fathers: he shall scatter their spoils, and their prey, and their riches, and shall forecast devices against the best fenced places: and this until a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And his strength and his heart shall be stirred up against the king of the south with a great army: and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with many and very strong succours: and they shall not stand, for they shall form designs against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they that eat bread with him, shall destroy him, and his army shall be overthrown: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the heart of the two kings shall be to do evil, and they shall speak lies at one table, and they shall not prosper: because as yet the end is unto another time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he shall return into his land with much riches: and his heart shall be against the holy covenant, and he shall succeed and shall return into his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> At the time appointed he shall return, and he shall come to the south, but the latter time shall not be like the former.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the galleys and the Romans shall come upon him, and he shall be struck, and shall return, and shall have indignation against the covenant of the sanctuary, and he shall succeed: and he shall return and shall devise against them that have forsaken the covenant of the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall defile the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the continual sacrifice, and they shall place there the abomination unto desolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And such as deal wickedly against the covenant shall deceitfully dissemble: but the people that know their God shall prevail and succeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they that are learned among the people shall teach many: and they shall fall by the sword, and by fire, and by captivity, and by spoil for many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And when they shall have fallen they shall be relieved with a small help: and many shall be joined to them deceitfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And some of the learned shall fall, that they may be tried, and may be chosen, and made white even to the appointed time, because yet there shall be another time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall be lifted up, and shall magnify himself against every god: and he shall speak great things against the God of gods, and shall prosper, till the wrath be accomplished. For the determination is made.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he shall make no account of the God of his fathers: and he shall follow the lust of women, and he shall not regard any gods: for he shall rise up against all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But he shall worship the god Maozim in his place: and a god whom his fathers knew not, he shall worship with gold, and silver, and precious stones, and things of great price.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he shall do this to fortify Maozim with a strange god, whom he hath acknowledged, and he shall increase glory and shall give them power over many, and shall divide the land gratis.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And at the time prefixed the king of the south shall fight against him, and the king of the north shall come against him like a tempest, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with a great navy, and he shall enter into the countries, and shall destroy, and pass through.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he shall enter into the glorious land, and many shall fall: and these only shall be saved out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and the principality of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And he shall lay his hand upon the lands: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he shall have power over the treasures of gold, and of silver, and all the precious things of Egypt: and he shall pass through Libya, and Ethiopia.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And tidings out of the east, and out of the north shall trouble him: and he shall come with a great multitude to destroy and slay many.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he shall fix his tabernacle Apadno between the seas, upon a glorious and holy mountain: and he shall come even to the top thereof, and none shall help him.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</p>
