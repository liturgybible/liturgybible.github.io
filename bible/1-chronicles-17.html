            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar : and the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy heart: for God is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one, of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler of my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are renowned in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I have given a place to my people Israel: they shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as at the beginning,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And king David came and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldst give such things to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus glorified thy servant, and known him?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have all the great things to be known.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For what other nation is there upon earth like thy people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations before their face whom he had delivered out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the house of David his servant remaineth before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence to pray before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised to thy servant such great benefits.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
