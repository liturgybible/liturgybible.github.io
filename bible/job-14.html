            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed ? is it not thou who only art?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> At the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But man when he shall be dead, and stripped and consumed, I pray you where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and an emptied river should be dried up:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again; till the heavens be broken, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who will grant me this, that thou mayest protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a. time when thou wilt remember me?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Shall man that is dead, thinkest thou, live again? all the days in which I am now in warfare, I expect until my change come.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thou indeed hast numbered my steps, but spare my sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured my iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A mountain falling cometh to nought, and a rock is removed out of its place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Waters wear away the stones, and with inundation the ground by little and little is washed away: so in like manner thou shalt destroy man.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou hast strengthened him for a little while, that he may pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him away.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But yet his flesh, while he shall live, shall have pain, and his soul shall mourn over him.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</p>
