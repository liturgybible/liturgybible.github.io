            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A faithful saying: if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality, a teacher,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not covetous, but</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all chastity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Deacons in like manner chaste, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And let these also first be proved: and so let them minister, having no crime.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The women in like manner chaste, not slanderers, but sober, faithful in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well their children, and their own houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For they that have ministered well, shall purchase to themselves a good degree, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee shortly.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world, is taken up in glory.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</p>

            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
