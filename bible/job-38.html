            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> when I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in a mist as in swaddling bands?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors :</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I said : Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.</p>

            <p data-verse="38:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Canst thou send lightnings, and will they go, and will they return and say to thee : Here we are?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the cock understanding?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Who can declare the order of the heavens, or who can make the harmony of heaven to sleep?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods fastened together?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Wilt thou take the prey for the lioness, and satisfy the appetite of her whelps,</p>
