            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as he was sitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three men standing near him: and as soon as he saw them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and adored down to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away from thy servant:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye your feet, and rest ye under the tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart, afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your servant. And they said: Do as thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Abraham made haste into the tent to Sera, and said to her: Make haste, temper together three measures of flour, and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence a calf very tender and very good, and gave it to a young man: who made haste and boiled it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he had boiled, and set before them: but he stood by them under the tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when they had eaten, they said to him: Where is Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo, she is in the tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to him: I will return and come to thee at this time, life accompanying and Sara thy wife shall have a son. Which when Sara heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now they were both old, and far advanced in years, and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of women.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she laughed secretly, saying: After I am grown old</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sera laugh, saying: Shall I who am an old woman bear a child indeed ?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Is there any thing hard to God? according to appointment I will return to thee at this same time, life accompanying, and Sara shall have a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for she was afraid. But the Lord said, Nay: but thou didst laugh:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when the men rose up from thence, they turned their eyes towards Sodom: and Abraham walked with them, bringing them on the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to do:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> "Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I know that he will command his children, and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord, and do judgment and justice: that for Abraham's sake the Lord may bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly grievous.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that is come to me: or whether it be not so, that I may know.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they turned themselves from thence, and went their way to Sodom: but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And drawing nigh he said: Wilt thou destroy the just with the wicked?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If there be fifty just men in the city, shall they perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just, if they be therein?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the just with the wicked, and for the just to be in like case as the wicked, this is not beseeming thee: thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not make this judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the Lord said to him: If I And in Sodom fifty just within the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Abraham answered, and said: Seeing I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> What if there be Ave less than fifty just persons? wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city? And he said: I will not destroy it, if I find five and forty.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And again he said to him: But if forty be found there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I speak: What if thirty shall be found there? He answered: I will not do it, if I And thirty there.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord. What if twenty be found there? He said: I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I speak yet once more: What if tell should be found there ? And he said: I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
