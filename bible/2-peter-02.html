            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be among you lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition, and deny the Lord who bought them: bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And many shall follow their riotousnesses, through whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their perdition slumbereth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And spared not the original world, but preserved Noe, the eighth person, the preacher of justice, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And reducing the cities of the Sodomites, and of the Gomorrhites, into ashes, condemned them to be overthrown, making them an example to those that should after act wickedly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And delivered just Lot, oppressed by the injustice and lewd conversation of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For in sight and hearing he was just: dwelling among them, who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from temptation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be tormented.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And especially them who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government, audacious, self willed, they fear not to bring in sects, blaspheming.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Whereas angels who are greater in strength and power, bring not against themselves a railing judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But these men, as irrational beasts, naturally tending to the snare and to destruction, blaspheming those things which they know not, shall perish in their corruption,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Receiving the reward of their injustice, counting for a pleasure the delights of a day: stains and spots, sporting themselves to excess, rioting in their feasts with you:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not: alluring unstable souls, having their heart exercised with covetousness, children of malediction:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Leaving the right way they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But had a check of his madness, the dumb beast used to the yoke, which speaking with man's voice, forbade the folly of the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> These are fountains without water, and clouds tossed with whirlwinds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For, speaking proud words of vanity, they allure by the desires of fleshly riotousness, those who for a little while escape, such as converse in error:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Promising them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption. For by whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For if, flying from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they be again entangled in them and overcome: their latter state is become unto them worse than the former.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, than after they have known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For, that of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog is returned to his vomit: and, The sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</p>
