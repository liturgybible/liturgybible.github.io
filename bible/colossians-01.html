            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hearing your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which you have towards all the saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the hope that is laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard in the word of the truth of the gospel,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole world, and bringeth forth fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who also hath manifested to us your love in the spirit.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The mystery which hath been hidden from ages and generations, but now is manifested to his saints,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> To whom God would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Whom we preach, admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.</p>
