            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all the ceremonies and justifications thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make the phase.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they made it in its proper time: the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in mount Sinai. The children of Israel did according to all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a men, who could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Said to them: We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man. Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Moses answered them: Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, a nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season: he shall bear his sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof. The same ordinance shall be with you both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered it. But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it were the appearance of fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up, then the children of Israel marched forward: and in the place where the cloud stood still, there they camped.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his commandment they pitched the tabernacle. All the days that the cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his commandment they took them down.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word they marched: and kept the watches of the Lord according to his commandment by the hand of Moses.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
