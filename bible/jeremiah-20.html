            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Phassur the son of Emmur, the priest, who was appointed chief in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias prophesying these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Phassur struck Jeremias the prophet, and put him in the stocks, that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when it was light the next day, Phassur brought Jeremias out of the stocks. And Jeremias said to him: The Lord hath not called thy name Phassur, but fear on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver thee up to fear, thee and all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it, and I will give all Juda into the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall strike them with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I will give all the substance of this city, and all its labour, and every precious thing thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Juda will I give into the hands of their enemies: and they shall pillage them, and take them away, and carry them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But thou, Phassur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity, and thou shalt go to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there thou shalt be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied a lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I am deceived: thou hast been stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I am become a laughing-stock all the day, all scoff at me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For I am speaking now this long time, crying out against iniquity, and I often proclaim devistation: and the word of the Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then I said: I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name: and there came in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was wearied, not being able to bear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the men that were my familiars, and continued at my side: if by any means he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior: therefore they that persecute me shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be greatly confounded, because they have not understood the everlasting reproach, which never shall be effaced.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou, O Lord of hosts, prover of the just, who seest the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Sing ye to the Lord, praise the Lord: because he hath delivered the soul of the poor out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Cursed be the day wherein I was borne: let not the day in which my mother bore me, be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father, saying: A man child is born to thee: and made him greatly rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let that man be as the cities that the Lord hath overthrown, and hath not repented: let him hear a cry in the morning, and howling at noontide:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Who slew me not from the womb, that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb an everlasting conception.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Why came I out of the womb, to see labour and sorrow, and that my days should be spent in confusion?</p>

            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</p>
