            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth was gone, and the sea is now no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I heard a great voice from the throne, saying: Behold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them. And they shall be his people; and God himself with them shall be their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the former things are passed away.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me: Write, for these words are most faithful and true.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said to me: It is done. I am Alpha and Omega; the beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth, I will give of the fountain of the water of life, freely.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He that shall overcome shall possess these things, and I will be his God; and he shall be my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, they shall have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there came one of the seven angels, who had the vials full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying: Come, and I will shew thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain: and he shewed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Having the glory of God, and the light thereof was like to a precious stone, as to the jasper stone, even as crystal.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it had a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and in the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> On the east, three gates: and on the north, three gates: and on the south, three gates: and on the west, three gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them, the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he that spoke with me, had a measure of a reed of gold, to measure the city and the gates thereof, and the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the city lieth in a foursquare, and the length thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with the golden reed for twelve thousand furlongs, and the length and the height and the breadth thereof are equal.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is of an angel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone: but the city itself pure gold, like to clear glass.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper: the second, sapphire: the third, a chalcedony: the fourth, an emerald:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The fifth, sardonyx: the sixth, sardius: the seventh, chrysolite: the eighth, beryl: the ninth, a topaz: the tenth, a chrysoprasus: the eleventh, a jacinth: the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one to each: and every several gate was of one several pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I saw no temple therein. For the Lord God Almighty is the temple thereof, and the Lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to shine in it. For the glory of God hath enlightened it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there shall be no night there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> There shall not enter into it any thing defiled, or that worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they that are written in the book of life of the Lamb.</p>
