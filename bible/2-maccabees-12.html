            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jonathan saw that the time served him, and he chose certain men and sent them to Rome, to confirm and to renew the amity with them:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he sent letters to the Spartans, and to other places according to the same form.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and said: Jonathan the high priest, and the nation of the Jews have sent us to renew the amity, and alliance as it was before.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they gave them letters to their governors in every place, to conduct them into the land of Juda with peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And this is a copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Jonathan the high priest, and the ancients of the nation, and the priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to the Spartans, their brethren, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There were letters sent long ago to Onias the high priest from Arius who reigned then among you, to signify that you are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Onias received the ambassador with honour: and received the letters wherein there was mention made of the alliance, and amity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> We, though we needed none of these things, having for our comfort the holy books that are in our hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Chose rather to send to you to renew the brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers to you altogether: for there is a long time passed since you sent to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our festivals, and other days, wherein it is convenient, remember you in the sacrifices that we offer, and in our observances, as it is meet, and becoming to remember brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And we rejoice at your glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we have had many troubles and wars on every side, and the kings that are round about us, have fought against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But we would not be troublesome to you, nor the rest of our allies and friends in these wars.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For we have had help from heaven, and we have been delivered, and our enemies are humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> We have chosen therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans to renew with them the former amity and alliance.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And we have commanded them to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters, concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And now you shall do well to give us an answer hereto.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this is the copy of the letter which he had sent to Onias:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Arius king of the Spartans to Onias the high priest, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> It is found in writing concerning the Spartans, and the Jews, that they are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And now since this is come to our knowledge, you do well to write to us of your prosperity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And we also have written back to you: That our cattle, and our possessions are yours: and yours, ours. We therefore have commanded that these things should be told you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come again with a greater army than before to fight against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So he went out from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amath: for he gave them no time to enter into his country.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he sent spies into their camp, and they came back and brought him word that they designed to come upon them in the night.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the sun was set, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be in arms all night long ready to fight, and he set sentinels round about the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the enemies heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they were struck with fear, and dread in their heart: and they kindled fires in their camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But Jonathan and they that were with him knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: for they had passed the river Eleutherus.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Jonathan turned upon the Arabians that are called Zabadeans: and he defeated them, and took the spoils of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he went forward, and came to Damascus, and passed through all that country.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Simon also went forth, and came as far as Ascalon, and the neighbouring fortresses, and he turned aside to Joppe, and took possession of it,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> (For he heard that they designed to deliver the hold to them that took part with Demetrius,) and he put a garrison there to keep it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Jonathan came back, and called together the ancients of the people, and he took a resolution with them to build fortresses in Judea,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And to build up walls in Jerusalem, and raise a mount between the castle and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might have no communication, and that they might neither buy nor sell.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they came together to build up the city: for the wall that was upon the brook towards the east was broken down, and he repaired that which is called Caphetetha:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Simon built Adiada in Sephela, and fortified it, and set up gates and bars.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of Asia, and to take the crown, and to stretch out his hand against king Antiochus:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Fearing lest Jonathan would not suffer him, but would fight against him: he sought to seize upon him, and to kill him. So he rose up and came to Bethsan.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethsan.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Now when Tryphon saw that Jonathan came with a great army, he durst not stretch forth his hand against him,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But received him with honour, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him presents: and he commanded his troops to obey him, as himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he said to Jonathan: Why hast thou troubled all the people, whereas we have no war?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Now therefore send them back to their own houses: and choose thee a few men that may be with thee, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will deliver it to thee, and the rest of the strong holds, and the army, and all that have any charge, and I will return and go away: for this is the cause of my coming.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Jonathan believed him, and did as he said: and sent away his army, and they departed into the land of Juda:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> But he kept with him three thousand men: of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates of the city, and took him: and all them that came in with him they slew with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain to destroy all Jonathan's company.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> But they, when they understood that Jonathan and all that were with him were taken and slain, encouraged one another, and went out ready for battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Then they that had come after them, seeing that they stood for their lives, returned back.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of Juda. And they bewailed Jonathan, and them that had been with him, exceedingly: and Israel mourned with great lamentation.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Then all the heathens that were round about them, sought to destroy them. For they said:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> They have no prince, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away the memory of them from amongst mem.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king, and the Jews were about their husbandry.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, and Apollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon, and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not suffer them to be quiet and live in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayed the Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives and children into the boats which they had prepared, as though they had meant them no hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who accepted of it according to the common decree of the city, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspecting nothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, they drowned no less than two hundred of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, he commanded those that were with him to make them ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came against those murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night, and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if he would return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in like manner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on the haven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen at Jerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in their journey toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men on foot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas’ side by the help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia, being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to give him cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable in many things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, and so they departed to their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city, which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people of divers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But they that were within it put such trust in the strength of the walls and provision of victuals, that they behaved themselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing and blaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lord of the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast down Jericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against the walls,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakable slaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad near adjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running with blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are called Tubieni.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: for before he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence, having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus’ captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left in the fortress, above ten thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over the bands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and five hundred horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas’ coming, he sent the women and children and the other baggage unto a fortress called Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy to come unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies, being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of him who seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way, another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their own men, and wounded with the points of their own swords.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing those wicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him go with his life, because he had many of the Jews’ parents, and the brethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, should not be regarded.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So when he had assured them with many words that he would restore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they let him go for the saving of their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple of Atargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judas removed the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysias abode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strong young men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: wherein also was great provision of engines and darts.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God, who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, they won the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them that were within,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth six hundred furlongs from Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that the Scythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated them kindly in the time of their adversity;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly still unto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeks approaching.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forth against Gorgias the governor of Idumea,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundred horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And it happened that in their fighting together a few of the Jews were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor’s company, who was on horseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and taking hold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have taken that cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon him smote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, and were weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shew himself to be their helper and leader of the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalms with a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias’ men, he put them to flight.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city of Odollam, And when the seventh day came, they purified themselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the same place.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas and his company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain, and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers’ graves.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Now under the coats of every one that was slain they found things consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which is forbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this was the cause wherefore they were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, who had opened the things that were hid,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sin committed might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, that noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin, forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came to pass for the sins of those that were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And when he had made a gathering throughout the company to the sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it to Jerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well and honestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should have risen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And also in that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and good thought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin.</p>
