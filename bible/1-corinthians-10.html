            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And did all eat the same spiritual food,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> What then ? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any thing ?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Let no man seek his own, but that which is another's.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience' sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience' sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience ?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</p>

            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it .</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.</p>
