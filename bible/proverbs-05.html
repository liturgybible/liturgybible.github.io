            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man's house,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not in- dined my ear to masters?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:</p>

            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; he thou delighted continually with her love.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another ?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</p>
