            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Better is the poor man, that walketh in his simplicity, than a rich man that is perverse in his lips, and unwise.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The folly of a man supplanteth his seeps: and he fretteth in his mind against God.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Riches make many friends: but from the poor man, even they whom he had, depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Many honour the person of him that is mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him. He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence shall find good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The learning of a man is known by patience and his glory is to pass over wrongs.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away he shall add another thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in fulness without being visited with evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The wicked man being; scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man he will understand discipline.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</p>
