            <p data-verse="102:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The prayer of the poor man, when he was anxious, and poured out his supplication before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, O Lord, my prayer: and let my cry come to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Turn not away thy face from me: in the day when I am in trouble, incline thy ear to me. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me speedily.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For my days are vanished like smoke: and my bones are grown dry like fuel for the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered: because I forgot to eat my bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness: I am like a night raven in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the housetop.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All the day long my enemies reproached me: and they that praised me did swear against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because of thy anger and indignation: for having lifted me up thou hast thrown me down.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever: and thy memorial to all generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion: for it is time to have mercy on it, for the time is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall have pity on the earth thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the Lord hath built up Sion: and he shall be seen in his glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not despised their petition.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let these things be written unto another generation: and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="102:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary: from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters: that he might release the children of the slain:</p>
            <p data-verse="102:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion: and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
            <p data-verse="102:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He answered him in the way of his strength: Declare unto me the fewness of my days.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Call me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are unto generation and generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth: end the heavens are the works of thy hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They shall perish but thou remainest: and all of them shall grow old like a garment: And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="102:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The children of thy servants shall continue: and their seed shall be directed for ever.</p>
