            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall I say to them?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go, gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you: and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they shall hear thy voice: and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us: we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I will stretch forth my hand and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will let you go.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</p>
