            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the hundred and fifty-first year Demetrius the son of Seleucus departed from the city of Rome, and came up with a few men into a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, as he entered into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, that the army seized upon Antiochus, and Lysias, to bring them unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he knew it, he said: Let me not see their face.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So the army slew them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there came to him the wicked and ungodly men of Israel: And Alcimus was at the head of them, who desired to be made high priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they accused the people to the king, saying: Judas and his brethren have destroyed all thy friends, and he hath driven us out of our land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go, and see all the havock he hath made amongst us, and in the king's lands: and let him punish all his friends and their helpers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then the king chose Bacchides, one of his friends that ruled beyond the great river in the kingdom, and was faithful to the king: and he sent him,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> To see the havock that Judas had made: and the wicked Alcimus he made high priest, and commanded him to take revenge upon the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they arose, and came with a great army into the land of Juda: and they sent messengers, and spoke to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But they gave no heed to their words: for they saw that they were come with a great army.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then there assembled to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of the scribes to require things that are just:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And first the Assideans that were among the children of Israel, and they sought peace of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For they said: One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come, he will not deceive us.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he spoke to them peaceably: and he swore to them, saying: We will do you no harm nor your friends.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they believed him. And he took threescore of them, and slew them in one day, according to the word that is written:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The flesh of thy saints, and the blood of them they have shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people: for they said: There is no truth, nor justice among them: for they have broken the covenant, and the oath which they made.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Bacchides removed the camp from Jerusalem, and pitched in Bethzecha: and he sent, and took many of them that were fled away from him, and some of the people he killed, and threw them into a great pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then he committed the country to Alcimus, and left with him troops to help him. So Bacchides went away to the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Alcimus did what he could to maintain his chief priesthood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they that disturbed the people resorted to him, and they got the land of Juda into their power, and did much hurt in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus, and they that were with him, did to the children of Israel, much more than the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he went out into all the coasts of Juda round about, and took vengeance upon the men that had revolted, and they ceased to go forth any more into the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Alcimus saw that Judas, and they that were with him prevailed: and he knew that he could not stand against them, and he went back to the king, and accused them of many crimes.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the king sent Nicanor one of his principal lords, who was a great enemy to Israel: and he commanded him to destroy the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great army, and he sent to Judas and to his brethren deceitfully with friendly words,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Saying: Let there be no fighting between me and you: I will come with a few men to see your faces with peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably: and the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the thing was known to Judas that he was come to him with deceit: and he was much afraid of him, and would not see his face any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered: and he went out to fight against Judas near Capharsalama.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And there fell of Nicanor's army almost five thousand men, and they fled into the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And after this Nicanor went up into mount Sion: and some of the priests and the people came out to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the holocausts that were offered for the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But he mocked them and despised them, and abused them: and he spoke proudly,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And swore in anger, saying: Unless Judas and his army be delivered into my hands, as soon as ever I return in peace, I will burn this house. And he went out in a great rage.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the priests went in, and stood before the face of the altar and the temple: and weeping, they said:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thou, O Lord, hast chosen this house for thy name to be called upon therein, that it might be a house of prayer and supplication for thy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Be avenged of this man, and his army, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem, and encamped near to Bethoron: and an army of Syria joined him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But Judas pitched in Adarsa with three thousand men: and Judas prayed, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> O Lord, when they that were sent by king Sennacherib blasphemed thee, an angel went out, and slew of them a hundred and eighty-five thousand:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Even so destroy this army in our sight to day, and let the rest know that he hath spoken ill against thy sanctuary: and judge thou him according to his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the armies joined battle on the thirteenth day of the month Adar: and the army of Nicanor was defeated, and he himself was first slain in the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain, they threw away their weapons, and fled:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And they pursued after them one day's journey from Adazer, even till ye come to Gazara, and they sounded the trumpets after them with signals.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they went forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and they pushed them with the horns, and they turned again to them, and they were all slain with the sword, and there was not left of them so much as one.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And they took the spoils of them for a booty, and they cut off Nicanor's head, and his right hand, which he had proudly stretched out, and they brought it, and hung it up over against Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they spent that day with great joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And he ordained that this day should be kept every year, being the thirteenth of the month of Adar.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And the land of Juda was quiet for a short time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their mother were taken, and compelled by the king against the law to taste swine’s flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldest thou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldrons to be made hot:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out the tongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost parts of his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commanded him being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good space dispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to die manfully, saying thus,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort in us, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces, declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So when the first was dead after this number, they brought the second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wilt thou eat, before thou be punished throughout every member of thy body?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Wherefore he also received the next torment in order, as the former did.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but the King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlasting life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he was required, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holding forth his hands manfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for his laws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him, marvelled at the young man’s courage, for that he nothing regarded the pains.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangled the fourth in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised up again by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection to life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power over men, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet think not that our nation is forsaken of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he will torment thee and thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to die said, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive against God, that thou shalt escape unpunished.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy of honourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain within the space of one day, she bare it with a good courage, because of the hope that she had in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language, filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanish thoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gave you breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members of every one of you;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed the generation of man, and found out the beginning of all things, will also of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as ye now regard not your own selves for his laws’ sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting it to be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with oaths, that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he would take him for his friend, and trust him with affairs.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, the king called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counsel the young man to save his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised him that she would counsel her son.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrant to scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, and consider that God made them of things that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren, take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thy brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said, Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king’s commandment: but I will obey the commandment of the law that was given unto our fathers by Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For we suffer because of our sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And though the living Lord be angry with us a little while for our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one again with his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be not lifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes, lifting up thy hand against the servants of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God, who seeth all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, are dead under God’s covenant of everlasting life: but thou, through the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily be merciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that he alone is God;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Than the king’ being in a rage, handed him worse than all the rest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Last of all after the sons the mother died.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning the idolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.</p>
