            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass, when the nations round about heard that the altar and the sanctuary were built up as before, that they were exceeding angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they thought to destroy the generation of Jacob that were among them, and they began to kill some of the people, and to persecute them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea, and them that were in Acrabathane: because they beset the Israelites around about, and he made a great slaughter of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he remembered the malice of the children of Bean: who were a snare and a stumblingblock to the people, by lying in wait for them in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they were shut up by him in towers, and he set upon them, and devoted them to utter destruction, and burnt their towers with fire, and all that were in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then he passed over to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, and Timotheus was their captain:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he fought many battles with them, and they were discomfited in their sight, and he smote them:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he took the city of Gazer and her towns, and returned into Judea.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Gentiles that were in Galaad, assembled themselves together against the Israelites that were in their quarters to destroy them: and they fled into the fortress of Datheman.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they sent letters to Judas and his brethren, saying, The heathens that are round about are gathered together against us, to destroy us:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they are preparing to come, and to take the fortress into which we are fled: and Timotheus is the captain of their host.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now therefore come, and deliver us out of their hands, for many of us are slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And all our brethren that were in the places of Tubin, are killed: and they have carried away their wives, and their children, captives, and taken their spoils, and they have slain there almost a thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And while they were yet reading these letters, behold there came other messengers out Galilee with their garments rent, who related according to these words:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Saying, that they of Ptolemais, and of Tyre, and of Sidon, were assembled against them, and all Galilee is filled with strangers, in order to consume us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now when Judas and all the people heard these words, a great assembly met together to consider what they should do for their brethren that were in trouble, and were assaulted by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Judas said to Simon his brother: Choose thee men, and go, and deliver they brethren in Galilee: and I, and my brother Jonathan will go into the country of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias captains of the people with the remnant of the army in Judea to keep it:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he commanded them, saying: Take ye the charge of this people: but make no war against the heathens, till we return.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now three thousand men were alloted to Simon, to go into Gallilee: and eight thousand to Judas to go into the land of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Simon went into Galilee, and fought many battles with the heathens: and the heathens were discomfited before his face, and he pursued them even to the gate of Ptolemais.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And there fell of the heathens almost three thousand men, and he took the spoils of them,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took with him those that were in Galilee and in Arbatis with their wives, and children, and all that they had, and he brought them into Judea with great joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Judas Machabeus, and Jonathan his brother passed over the Jordan, and went three days' journey through the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Nabutheans met them, and received them in a peaceable manner, and told them all that happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And that many of them were shut up in Barasa, and in Bosor, and in Alima, and in Casphor, and in Mageth, and in Carnaim: all these strong and great cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Yea, and that they were kept shut up in the rest of the cities of Galaad, and that they had appointed to bring their army on the morrow near to these cities, and to take them and to destroy them all in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Judas and his army suddenly turned their march into the desert, to Bosor, and took the city: and he slew every male by the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnt it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they removed from thence by night, and went till they came to the fortress.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And it came to pass that early in the morning, when they lifted up their eyes, behold there were people without number, carrying ladders and engines to take the fortress, and assault them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Judas saw that the fight was begun, and the cry of the battle went up to heaven like a trumpet, and a great cry out of the city:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he said to his host: Fight ye to day for your brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he came with three companies behind them, and they sounded their trumpets, and cried out in prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the host of Timotheus understood that it was Machabeus, and they fled away before his face: and they made a great slaughter of them: and there fell of them in that day almost eight thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Judas turned aside to Maspha, and assaulted, and took it, and he slew every male thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burnt it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> From thence he marched, and took Casbon, and Mageth, and Bosor, and the rest of the cities of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But after this Timotheus gathered another army, and camped over against Raphon beyond the torrent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Judas sent men to view the army: and they brought him word, saying: All the nations, that are round about us, are assembled unto him an army exceeding great:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they have hired the Arabians to help them, and they have pitched their tents beyond the torrent, ready to come to fight against thee. And Judas went to meet them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Timotheus said to the captains of his army: When Judas and his army come near the torrent of water, if he pass over unto us first, we shall not be able to withstand him: for he will certainly prevail over us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> But if he be afraid to pass over, and camp on the other side of the river, we will pass over to them and shall prevail against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Now when Judas came near the torrent of water, he set the scribes of the people by the torrent, and commanded them, saying: Suffer no man to stay behind: but let all come to the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he passed over to them first, and all the people after him, and all the heathens were discomfited before them, and they threw away their weapons, and fled to the temple that was in Carnaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he took that city, and the temple he burnt with fire, with all things that were therein: and Carnaim was subdued, and could not stand against the face of Judas.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the land of Galaad, from the least even to the greatest, and their wives, and children, and an army exceeding great, to come into the land of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they came as far as Ephron: now this was a great city situate in the way, strongly fortified, and there was no means to turn from it on the right hand or on the left, but the way was through the midst of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And they that were in the city, shut themselves in, and stopped up the gates with stones: and Judas sent to them with peaceable words,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Saying: Let us pass through your land, to go into our country: and no man shall hurt you: we will only pass through on foot. But they would not open to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the camp, that they should make an assault every man in the place where he was.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And the men of the army drew near, and he assaulted that city all the day, and all the night, and the city was delivered into his hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And they slew every male with the edge of the sword, and he razed the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through all the city over them that were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then they passed over the Jordan to the great plain that is over against Bethsan.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And Judas gathered together the hindmost, and he exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain, till they had returned in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias captain of the soldiers, heard of the good success, and the battles that were fought.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And he said: Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards Jamnia.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> And Gorgias and his men went out of the city, to give them battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there fell, on that day, of the people of Israel about two thousand men, and there was a great overthrow of the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> Because they did not hearken to Judas, and his brethren, thinking that they should do manfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was brought to Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And the men of Juda were magnified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the nations where their name was heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children of Esau, in the land toward the south, and he took Chebron, and her towns: and he burnt the walls thereof and the towers all round it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he went through Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> In that day some priests fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully they went out unadvisedly to fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> And Judas turned to Azotus into the land of the strangers, and he threw down their altars, and he burnt the statues of their gods with fire: and he took the spoils of the cities, and returned into the land of Juda.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage into Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And then it happened, that through all the city, for the space almost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band of soldiers,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running one against another, with shaking of shields, and multitude of pikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn to good.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men, and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that were upon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken, Menelaus fled into the castle:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, not considering that to get the day of them of his own nation would be a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been his enemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but at the last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accused before Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city to city, pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, and being had in abomination as an open enemy of his country and countrymen, he was cast out into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished in a strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinking there to find succour by reason of his kindred:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn for him, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with his fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now when this that was done came to the king’s car, he thought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egypt in a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met, and to slay such as went up upon the houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men, women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there were destroyed within the space of three whole days fourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in the conflict; and no fewer sold than slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go into the most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his own country, being his guide:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and with profane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated by other kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of the place, he gave them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered not that the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, this man, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, and put back from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucus the king sent to view the treasury.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place’s sake, but the place far the people’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with them of the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterward communicate in the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the great Lord being reconciled, it was set up with all glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste unto Antiochia, weening in his pride to make the land navigable, and the sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem, Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners more barbarous than he that set him there;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worse than all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having a malicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with an army of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay all those that were in their best age, and to sell the women and the younger sort:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbear till the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keeping holy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating of the sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slew great multitudes.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrew himself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains after the manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbs continually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution.</p>
