            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If thou be made the master of a feast, lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place, that thou mayest be merry with them, and receive a crown for thy well ordering of the feast.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak, thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound judgment; and hinder not musick.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Pour not out words where there is a musician, and shew not forth wisdom out of time.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A concert of musick in a banquet of wine is as a signet of carbuncle set in gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As a signet of an emerald set in a work of gold, so is the melody of musick with pleasant wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Speak, young man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let thy speech be short, comprehending much in few words; be as one that knoweth and yet holdeth his tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If thou be among great men, make not thyself equal with them; and when ancient men are in place, use not many words.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Before the thunder goeth lightning; and before a shamefaced man shall go favour.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Rise up betimes, and be not the last; but get thee home without delay.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> There take thy pastime, and do what thou wilt: but sin not by proud speech.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And for these things bless him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whoso feareth the Lord will receive his discipline; and they that seek him early shall find favour.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that seeketh the law shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They that fear the Lord shall find judgment, and shall kindle justice as a light.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A sinful man will not be reproved, but findeth an excuse according to his will.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A man of counsel will be considerate; but a strange and proud man is not daunted with fear, even when of himself he hath done without counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Do nothing without advice; and when thou hast once done, repent not.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Go not in a way wherein thou mayest fall, and stumble not among the stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Be not confident in a plain way.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And beware of thine own children.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> In every good work trust thy own soul; for this is the keeping of the commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He that believeth in the Lord taketh heed to the commandment; and he that trusteth in him shall fare never the worse.</p>
