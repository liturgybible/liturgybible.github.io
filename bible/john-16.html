            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Of sin: because they believed not in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
