            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he brought me forth into the outward court by the way that leadeth to the north, and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate building, and over against the house toward the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the face of the north door was the length of a hundred cubits, and the breadth of fifty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Over against the twenty cubits of the inner court, and over against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone, where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And before the chambers was a walk ten cubits broad, looking to the inner parts of a way of one cubit. And their doors were toward the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Where were the store chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they wore as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going is to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south : there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass: for it is a holy place.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court: but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</p>
