            <p data-verse="48:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</p>
            <p data-verse="48:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day;</p>
            <p data-verse="48:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said to Joseph his son: Be- hold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite a with my sword and bow.</p>

            <p data-verse="48:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?</p>
            <p data-verse="48:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>
