            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed): but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but in my infirmities.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in the same steps?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</p>
