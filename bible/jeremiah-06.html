            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Strengthen yourselves, ye sons of Benjamin, in the midst of Jerusalem, and sound the trumpet in Thecua, and set up the standard over Bethacarem: for evil is seen out of the north, and a great destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks: they have pitched their tents against her round about: every one shall feed them that are under his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Prepare ye war against her: arise, and let us go up at midday: woe unto us, for the day is declined, for the shadows of the evening are grown longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hew down her trees, cast up a trench about Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited, all oppression is in the midst of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As a cistern maketh its water cold, so hath she made her wickedness cold: violence and spoil shall be heard in her, infirmity and stripes are continually before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land uninhabited.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall gather the remains of Israel, as in a vine, even to one cluster: turn back thy hand, as a grape gatherer into the basket.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I testify, that he may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: behold the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach: and and they will not receive it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the child abroad, and upon the council of the young men together: for man and woman shall be taken, the ancient and he that is full of days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And their houses shall be turned over to others, with their lands and their wives together: for I will stretch for my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For from the least of them even to the greatest, all are given to covetousness: and from the prophet even to the priest, all are guilty of deceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: and there was no peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They were confounded, because they commmitted abomination: yea, rather they were not confounded with confusion, and they knew not how to blush: wherefore they shall fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall fall down, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye on the ways, and see and ask for the old paths which is the good way, and walk ye in it: and you shall find refreshment for your souls. And they said: we will not walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not hearken.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what great things I will do to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Hear, O earth: Behold I will bring evils upon this people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast away my law.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together shall fall, neighbor and kinsman shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the land of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel, and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against thee, O daughter of Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labor.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and thou shalt know and prove their way.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> All of these princes go out of the way, they walk deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all corrupted.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>
