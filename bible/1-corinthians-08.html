            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But if any any love God, the same is known by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many);</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died ?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</p>
