            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither delight in ungodly sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Though they multiply, rejoice not in them, except the fear of the Lord be with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is just is better than a thousand; and better it is to die without children, than to have them that are ungodly.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For by one that hath understanding shall the city be replenished: but the kindred of the wicked shall speedily become desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Many such things have I seen with mine eyes, and mine ear hath heard greater things than these.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the congregation of the ungodly shall a fire be kindled; and in a rebellious nation wrath is set on fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He was not pacified toward the old giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither spared he the place where Lot sojourned, but abhorred them for their pride.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Nor the six hundred thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he judgeth a man according to his works</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The sinner shall not escape with his spoils: and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that he should not know him, that his powerful works might be known to the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> His mercy is manifest to every creature; and he hath separated his light from the darkness with an adamant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Say not thou, I will hide myself from the Lord: shall any remember me from above? I shall not be remembered among so many people: for what is my soul among such an infinite number of creatures?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the deep, and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be moved when he shall visit.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The mountains also and foundations of the earth be shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> No heart can think upon these things worthily: and who is able to conceive his ways?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> It is a tempest which no man can see: for the most part of his works are hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who can declare the works of his justice? or who can endure them? for his covenant is afar off, and the trial of all things is in the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He that wanteth understanding will think upon vain things: and a foolish man erring imagineth follies.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> by son, hearken unto me, and learn knowledge, and mark my words with thy heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I will shew forth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The works of the Lord are done in judgment from the beginning: and from the time he made them he disposed the parts thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He garnished his works for ever, and in his hand are the chief of them unto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their works.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> None of them hindereth another, and they shall never disobey his word.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with his blessings.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> With all manner of living things hath he covered the face thereof; and they shall return into it again.</p>
