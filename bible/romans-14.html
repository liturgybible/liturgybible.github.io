            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
