            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestines to Gerara.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord appeared to him and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Isaac abode in Gerara.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister; for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would like him because of her beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Abimelech said: Why hadst thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they digged in the torrent, and found living water.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they digged also another; and for that they quarreled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he went up from that place to Bersabee,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Where the Lord appeared to him that same might, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants to dig a well.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from Gerara,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee: but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>
