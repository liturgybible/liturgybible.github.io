            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs and ours.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That no flesh should glory in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>
