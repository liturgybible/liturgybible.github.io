            <p data-verse="48:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear ye these things, O house of Jacob, you that are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Juda, you who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For they are called of the holy city, and are established upon the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The former things of old I have declared, and they went forth out of my mouth, and I have made them to be heard: I did them suddenly and they came to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For I knew that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is as an iron sinew, and thy forehead as brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I foretold thee of old, before they came to pass I told thee, lest thou shouldst say: My idols have done these things, and my graven and molten things have commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> See now all the things which thou hast heard: but have you declared them? I have shewn thee new things from that time, and things are kept which thou knowest not:</p>
            <p data-verse="48:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They are created now, and not of old: and before the day, when thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldst say: Behold I knew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast neither heard, nor known, neither was thy ear opened of old. For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress, and I have called thee a transgressor from the womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For my name's sake I will remove my wrath far off: and for my praise I will bridle thee, lest thou shouldst perish.</p>

            <p data-verse="48:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things, that govern thee in the way that thou walkest.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments: thy peace had been as a river, and thy justice as the waves of the sea,</p>
            <p data-verse="48:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And thy seed had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: his name should not have perished, nor have been destroyed from before my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Come forth out of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, declare it with the voice of joy: make this to be heard, and speak it out even to the ends of the earth. Say: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="48:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They thirsted not in the desert, when he led them out: he brought forth water out of the rock for them, and he clove the rock, and the waters gushed out.</p>
