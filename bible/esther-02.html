            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After this, when the wrath of king Assuerus was appeased, he remembered Vasthi, and what she had done end what she had suffered:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king's servants and his officers said: Let young women be sought for the king, virgins and beautiful,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let some persons be sent through all the provinces to look for beautiful maidens and virgins: and let them bring them to the city of Susan, and put them into the house of the women under the hand of Egeus the eunuch, who is the overseer and keeper of the king's women: and let them receive women's ornaments, and other things necessary for their use.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And whosoever among them all shall please the king's eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There was a man in the city of Susan, a Jew, named Mardochai, the son of Jair, the son of Semei, the son of Cis, of the race of Jemini,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem at the time that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon carried away Jechonias king of Juda,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he had brought up his brother's daughter Edissa, who by another name was called Esther: now she had lost both her parents: and was exceeding fair and beautiful. And her father and mother being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the king's ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus the eunuch: Esther also among the rest of the maidens was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women's ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king's house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting maids.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai had charged her to say nothing at all of that:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the chosen virgins werre kept, having a care for Esther's welfare, and desiring to know what would befall her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when every virgin's turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to adorn themselves they received: and being decked out, as it pleased them, they passed from the chamber of the women to the king's chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz the eunuch, who had the charge over the king's concubines: neither could she re- turn any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her by name to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus the eunuch the keeper of the virgins had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceeding fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable and amiable in the eyes of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month, which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes, and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther. And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according to princely magnificence.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together, Mardochai stayed at the king's gate,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont at that time when he brought her up a little one.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king's gate, Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry: and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai's name, who had reported the thing unto her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> It was inquired into, and found out: and they were both hanged on a gibbet. And it was put in the histories, and recorded in the chronicles before the king.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>
