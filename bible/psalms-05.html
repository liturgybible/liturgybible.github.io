            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. A psalm of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see: because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the unjust abide before thy eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: Thou wilt destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my enemies, direct my way in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> for there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their devices: according to the multitude of their wickedness cast them out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that love thy name shall glory in thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as with a shield of thy good will.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>
