            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.</p>
