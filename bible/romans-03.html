            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> (I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As it is written: There is not any man just.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Their feet swift to shed blood:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Destruction and misery in their ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the way of peace they have not known:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>
