            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And after this he gathered together the ancients of Israel, and all the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the families, of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And all the men of Israel came to the king in the solemn day of the seventh month.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when all the ancients of Israel were come, the Levites took up the ark,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And brought it in, together with all the furniture of the tabernacle. And the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel, and all that were gathered together before the ark, sacrificed rams, and oxen without number: so great was the multitude of the victims.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings of the cherubims:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So that the cherubims spread their wings over the place, in which the ark was set, and covered the ark itself and its staves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried, because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle: but if a man were a little outward, he could not see them. So the ark has been there unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there was nothing else in the ark but the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the children of Israel, at their coming out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, (for all the priests that could be found there, mere sanctified: and as yet at that time the courses and orders of the ministries were not divided among them,)</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Both the Levites and the singing men, that is, both they that were under Asaph, and they that were under Heman, and they that were under Idithun, with their sons, and their brethren, clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing on the east side of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests, sounding with trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and organs, and with divers kind of musical instruments, and lifted up their voice on high : the sound was heard afar off, so that when they began to praise the Lord, and to say: Give glory to the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</p>
