            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore there is a judgment of the Lord with Juda, and a visitation for Jacob: he will render to him according to his ways, and according to his devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the womb he supplanted his brother: and by his strength he had success with an angel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he prevailed over the angel, and was strengthened: he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Even the Lord the God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore turn thou to thy God : keep mercy and judgment, and hope in thy God always.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He is like Chanaan, there is a deceitful balance in his hand, he hath loved oppression.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Ephraim said: But yet I am be- come rich, I have found me an idol: all my labours shall not find me the iniquity that I have committed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I that am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, will yet cause thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the feast.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I have spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If Galaad be an idol, then in vain were they in Galgal offering sacrifices with bullocks: for their altars also are as heaps in the furrows of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and was a keeper for a wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the Lord by a prophet brought Israel out of Egypt: and he was pre- served by a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath with his bitterness, and his blood shall come upon him, and his Lord will render his reproach unto him.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us;</p>

            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</p>
