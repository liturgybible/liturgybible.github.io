            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will take hold of thee, and bring thee Into my mother's house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I raised thee up: there thy mother was corrupted, there she was defloured that bore thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy as hard as hell, the lamps thereof are fire and flames.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Many waters cannot quench charity, neither can the floods drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, he shall despise it as nothing.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
