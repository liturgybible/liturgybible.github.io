            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle, in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said: The Lord is my rock, and my strength, and my saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> God is my strong one, in him will I trust: my shield, and the horn of my salvation: he lifteth me up, and is my refuge: my saviour, thou wilt deliver me from iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised: and I shall be saved from my enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the pangs of death have sur rounded me: the floods of Belial have made me afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The cords of hell compassed me: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In my distress I will call upon the Lord, and I will cry to my God: and he will hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come to his ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was angry with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a devouring fire out of his mouth: coals were kindled by it.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he rode upon the cherubims, and flew: and slid upon the wings of the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He made darkness a covering round about him: dropping waters out of the clouds of the heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were kindled.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the spirit of his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of many waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He delivered me from my most mighty enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For all his judgments are in my sight: and his precepts I have not removed from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I shall be perfect with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Lord will recompense me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> With the holy one thou wilt be holy: and with the valiant perfect.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the poor people thou wilt save: and with thy eyes thou wilt humble the haughty.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He teacheth my bands to war: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thou hast given me the shield of my salvation: and thy mildness hath multiplied me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall not fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will not return again till I consume them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that hated me, and I shall destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the Lord, and he shall not hear them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, shall serve me,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will obey me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my salvation shall be exalted:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under me,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Therefore will I give thanks to thee. O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
