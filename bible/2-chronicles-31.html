            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when these things had been duly celebrated, all Israel that were found in the cities of Juda, went out, and they broke the idols, and cut down the groves. demolished the high places, and destroyed the altars, not only out of all Juda and Benjamin, but out of Ephraim also and Manasses, till they had utterly destroyed them: then all the children of Israel returned to their possessions and cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Ezechias appointed companies of the priests, and the Levites, by their courses, every man in his own office, to wit, both of the priests, and of the Levites, for holocausts, and for peace offerings, to minister, and to praise, and to sing in the gates of the camp of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king's part was, that of his proper substance the holocaust should be offered always morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and the new moons and the other solemnities, as it is written in the law of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He commanded also the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to give to the priests, and the Levites their portion, that they might attend to the law of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the people, the children of Israel offered in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey: and brought the tithe of all things which the ground bringeth forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Moreover the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in the cities of Juda, brought in the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and the tithes of holy things, which they had vowed to the Lord their God: and carrying them all, made many heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, and in the seventh month, they finished them.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when Ezechias and his princes came in, they saw the heaps, and they blessed the Lord and the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Ezechias asked the priests and the Levites, why the heaps lay so.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Azarias the chief priest of the race of Sadoc answered him, saying: Since the firstfruits began to be offered in the house of the Lord, we have eaten, and have been filled, and abundance is left, because the Lord hath blessed his people: and of that which is left is this great store which thou seest.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Ezechias commanded to prepare storehouses in the house of the Lord. And when they had done so,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They brought in faithfully both the firstfruits, and the tithes, and all they had vowed. And the overseer of them was Chonenias the Levite, and Semei his brother was the second,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Nahath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath, and Banaias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the high priest of the house of God, to whom all things appertained.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But Core the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter of the east gate, was overseer of the things which were freely offered to the Lord, and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the holy of holies.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And under his charge were Eden, and Benjamin, Jesue, and Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the priests, to distribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little and great:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all that went into the temple of the Lord, and whatsoever there was need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their courses, day by day.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> To the priests by their families, and to the Levites from the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and companies.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to their children of both sexes, victuals were given faithfully out of the things that had been sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also of the sons of Aaron who were in the fields and in the suburbs of each city, there were men appointed, to distribute portions to all the males, among the priests and the Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So Ezechias did all things, which we have said in all Juda, and wrought that which was good; and right, and truth, before the Lord his God,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> In all the service of the ministry of the house of the Lord according to the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with all his heart, and he did it and prospered,</p>

            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</p>
