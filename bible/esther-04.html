            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head: and he cried with a loud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish of his mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the palace: for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king's court.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king's cruel edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then Esther's maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her. And when she heard it she was in a consternation: and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth: but he would not receive it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn of him why he did this.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street of the city, before the palace gate:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the Jews destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to en- treat him for her people.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ,11All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called unto him?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Mardochai had heard this,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king a house, more than all the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat nor drink for three days and three nights: and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king’s gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>
