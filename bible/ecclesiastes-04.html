            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I praised the dead rather than the living:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation of mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have the advantage of their society:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second young man, who shall rise up in his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The number of the people, of all that were before him is infinite: and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in him: but this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the house of God, and draw nigh to hear. For much better is obedience, than the victims of fools, who know not what evil they do.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
