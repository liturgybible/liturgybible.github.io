            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in, every man with his household:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Dan, and Nephtali, Gad and Aser.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom and Ramesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied, and increased:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay, and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the king called for them and said: What is that you meant to do, that you would save the men children ?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skillful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</p>
