            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt: and thou shalt prophesy of him, and of all Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, Pharao king of Egypt, thou great dragon that liest in the midst of thy rivers, and sayest: The river is mine, and I made myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But I will put a bridle in thy jaws: and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales: and I will draw thee out of the midst of thy rivers, and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I will cast thee forth into the desert, and all the fish of thy river: thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth, thou shalt not be taken up, nor gathered together: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord: because thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When they took hold of thee with the hand thou didst break, and rent all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brokest, and weakenest all their loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring the sword upon thee: and cut off man and beast out of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the land of Egypt shall become a desert, and a wilderness: and they shall know that I am the Lord: because thou hast said: The river is mine, and I made</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore, behold I come against thee, and thy rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt utterly desolate, and wasted by the sword, from the tower of Syene, even to the borders of Ethiopia.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The foot of man shall not pass through it, neither shall the foot of beasts go through it: nor shall it be inhabited during forty years.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For thus saith the Lord God: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they had been scattered.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> It shall be the lowest among other kingdoms, and it shall no more be exalted over the nations, and I will diminish them that they shall rule no more over the nations.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will set Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon in the land of Egypt: and he shall take her multitude, and take the booty thereof for a prey, and rifle the spoils thereof: and it shall be wages for his army.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And for the service that he hath done me against it: I have given him the land of Egypt, because he hath laboured for me, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> In that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
