            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>
