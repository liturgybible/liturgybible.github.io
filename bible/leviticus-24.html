            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee the finest and dearest oil of olives, to furnish the lamps continually,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant. And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the Lord continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou shalt take also fine hour, and shalt bake twelve leaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf :</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou shalt set them six and six one against another upon the most clean table before the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt put upon them the dearest frankincense, that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord, being received of the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they shall be Aaron's and his sons', that they may eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel, whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of Israel, and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to Moses: (now his mother was called Salumith, the daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan:)</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they put him into prison, till they might know what the Lord would command.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He that striketh a beast, shall render another. He that striketh a man shall be punished.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and they brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the camp, and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
