            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him, shall be put out.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The step of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in its meshes.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> A gin is hidden for him in the earth, and his trap upon the path.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Fears shall terrify him on every side, and shall entangle his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let his strength be wasted with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let the firstborn death consume his arms.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let destruction tread upon him like a king.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
