            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I have joyed in thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other beside thee, and there is none strong like our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt with strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They that were full before have hired out themselves for bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne many: and she that had many children is weakened.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to hell and bringeth back again.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he exalteth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and upon them he hath set the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them shall he thunder in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt the horn of his Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Nor the office of the priests to the people: but whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came, while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that came to Silo.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but raw.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be burnt to day according to the custom, and then take as much as thy soul desireth. But he answered and said to him: Not so: but thou shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being a child girded with a linen ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to offer the solemn sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him: The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent to the Lord. And they went to their own home.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel: and how they lay with the women that waited at the door of the tabernacle:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things, which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Do not so, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear, that you make the people of the Lord to transgress.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased both the Lord and men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my sitar, and burn incense to me, and to wear the ephod before me: and I gave to thy father's house of all the sacrifices of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every sacrifice of my people Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me: but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that despise me, shall be despised.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> However I will not altogether take away a man of thee from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent: and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man's estate.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: In one day they shall both of them die.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p>
