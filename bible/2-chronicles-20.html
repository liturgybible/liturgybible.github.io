            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After this the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them of the Ammonites, were gathered together to fight against Josaphat.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there came messengers, and told Josaphat, saying: There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea, and out of Syria, and behold they are in Asasonthamar, which is Engaddi.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Josaphat being seized with fear betook himself wholly to pray to the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Juda gathered themselves together to pray to the Lord: and all came out of their cities to make supplication to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Josaphat stood in the midst of the assembly of Juda, and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord before the new court,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And said: O Lord God of our fathers, thou art God in heaven, and rulest over all the kingdoms and nations, in thy hand is strength and power, and no one can resist thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Didst not thou our God kill all the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they dwelt in it, and built in it a sanctuary to thy name, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If evils fall upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand in thy presence before this house, in which thy name is called upon: and we will cry to thee in our afflictions, and thou wilt hear, and save us.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore behold the children of Ammon, and of Moab, and mount Seir, through whose lands thou didst not allow Israel to pass, when they came out of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and slew them not,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Do the contrary, and endeavour to cast us out of the possession which thou hast delivered to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> O our God, wilt thou not then judge them? as for us we have not strength enough, to be able to resist this multitude, which cometh violently upon us. But as we know not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And all Juda stood before the Lord with their little ones, and their wives, and their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jahaziel the son of Zacharias, the son of Banaias, the son of Jehiel, the son of Mathanias, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, was there, upon whom the spirit of the Lord came in the midst of the multitude,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said: Attend ye, all Juda, and you that dwell in Jerusalem, and thou king Josaphat: Thus saith the Lord to you: Fear ye not, and be not dismayed at this multitude: for the battle is not yours, but God's.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To morrow you shall go down against them: for they will come up by the ascent named Sis, and you shall find them at the head of the torrent, which is over against the wilderness of Jeruel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> It shall not be you that shall fight, but only stand with confidence, and you shall see the help of the Lord over you, O Juda, and Jerusalem: fear ye not, nor be you dismayed: to morrow you shall go out against them, and the Lord will be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Josaphat, and Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell hat on the ground before the Lord, and adored him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Levites of the sons of Caath, and of the sons of Core praised the Lord the God of Israel with a loud voice, on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and went out through the desert of Thecua: and as they were marching, Josaphat standing in the midst of them, said: Hear me, ye men of Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be secure: believe his prophets, and all things shall succeed well.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he gave counsel to the people, and appointed the singing men of the Lord, to praise him by their companies, and to go before the army, and with one voice to say: Give glory to the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when they began to sing praises, the Lord turned their ambushments upon themselves, that is to say, of the children of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who were come out to fight against Juda, and they were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the children of Ammon, and of Moab, rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to kill and destroy them: and when they had made an end of them, they turned also against one another, and destroyed one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when Juda came to the watch tower, that looketh toward the desert, they saw afar off all the country, for a great space, full of dead bodies, and that no one was left that could escape death.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Josaphat came, and all the people with him to take away the spoils of the dead, and they found among the dead bodies, stuff of various kinds, and garments, and most precious vessels: and they took them for themselves, insomuch that they could not carry all, nor in three days take away the spoils, the booty was so great.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And on the fourth day they were assembled in the valley of Blessing: for there they blessed the Lord, and therefore they called that place the valley of Blessing until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And every man of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem returned, and Josaphat at their head, into Jerusalem with great joy, because the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they came into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets into the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the kingdom of Josaphat was quiet, and God gave him peace round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Josaphat reigned over Juda, and he was five and thirty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned five and twenty years in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Azuba the daughter of Selahi.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and departed not from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> But yet he took not away the high places, and the people had not yet turned their heart to the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, first and last, are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> After these things Josaphat king of Juda made friendship with Ochozias king of Israel, whose works were very wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he was partner with him in making ships, to go to Tharsis: and they made the ships in Asiongaber.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Eliezer the son of Dodau of Maresa prophesied to Josaphat, saying: Because thou hast made a league with Ochozias, the Lord hath destroyed thy works, and the ships are broken, and they could not go to Tharsis.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-gaber.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</p>
