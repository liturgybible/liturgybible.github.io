            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom, because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means become most learned.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom: that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible learning.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that be judges of the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitude of nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from the Highest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judged aright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharp judgment shall be to them that be in high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man’s person, neither shall he stand in awe of any man’s greatness: for he hath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learn wisdom, and not fall away.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: and they that have learned such things shall find what to answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, and ye shall be instructed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easily seen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself first known unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for he shall find her sitting at his doors.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: and whoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteth them in every thought.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the very true beginning of her is the desire of discipline; and the care of discipline is love;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And incorruption maketh us near unto God:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kings of the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shall have no fellowship with wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world: and a wise king is the upholding of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shall do you good.</p>
