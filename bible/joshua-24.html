            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Josue gathered together all the tribes of Israel in Sichem, and called for the ancients, and the princes, and the judges, and the masters: and they stood in the sight of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river, Thare the father of Abraham, and Nachor: and they served strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I took your father Abraham from the borders of Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of Chanaan: and I multiplied his seed,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And gave him Isaac: and to him again I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with many signs and wonders.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea: and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in the wilderness a long time:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite, who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And when they fought against you, I delivered them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought against Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I blessed you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho. And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I sent before you hornets: and I drove them out from their places, the two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword nor with thy bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which you planted not.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect and most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people answered, and said: God forbid we should leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed, and among all the people through whom we passed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Josue said to the people: You will not be able to serve the Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and will not forgive your wickedness and sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good he hath done you.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Josue said to the people: You are witnesses, that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they answered: We are witnesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the people said to Josue: We will serve the Lord our God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of the Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and lie to the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he sent the people away every one to their own possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And after these things Josue the son of Null the servant of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they buried him in the border of his possession in Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount Gaas.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> ,31And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue, and of the ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had taken out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a hundred young ewes, and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Eleazar also the son of Aaron died: and they buried him in Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</p>
