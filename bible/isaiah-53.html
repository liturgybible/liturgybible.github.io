            <p data-verse="53:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Despised, and the most abject of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with infirmity: and his look was as it were hidden and despised, whereupon we esteemed him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our sorrows: and we have thought him as it were a leper, and as one struck by God and afflicted.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for our sins: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his bruises we are healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside into his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He was offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his mouth: he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He was taken away from distress, and from judgment: who shall declare his generation? because he is cut oh out of the land of the living: for the wickedness of my people have I struck him.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he shall give the ungodly for his burial, and the rich for his death: because he hath done no iniquity, neither was there deceit in his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord was pleased to bruise him in infirmity: if he shall lay down his life for sin, he shall see a long-lived seed, and the will of the Lord shall be prosperous in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because his soul hath laboured, he shall see and be filled: by his knowledge shall this my just servant justify many, and he shall bear their iniquities.</p>
            <p data-verse="53:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore will I distribute to him very many, and he shall divide the spoils of the strong, because he hath delivered his soul unto death, and was reputed with the wicked: and he hath borne the sins of many, and hath prayed for the transgressors.</p>
