            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</p>
