            <p data-verse="55:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication:</p>
            <p data-verse="55:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> the same are darts.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,</p>
            <p data-verse="55:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?</p>
            <p data-verse="55:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,</p>
            <p data-verse="55:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> and injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,</p>
            <p data-verse="55:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:</p>
            <p data-verse="55:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> he hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="55:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> they are divided by the wrath Of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and</p>
            <p data-verse="55:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="55:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
            <p data-verse="55:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
            <p data-verse="55:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was  against me: for there were many with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were  they drawn swords.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
            <p data-verse="55:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>
