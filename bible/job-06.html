            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Job answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As the sand of the sea this would appear heavier: therefore my words are full of sorrow :</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth death?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish are my meats.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy One.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end that I should keep patience?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot they shall be melted out of their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They are confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now you are come: and now seeing my affliction you are afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant in any thing, instruct me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> However finish what you have begun, give ear, and see whether I lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And you shall not And iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For now ye are no thing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>
