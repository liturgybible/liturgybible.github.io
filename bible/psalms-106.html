            <p data-verse="106:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who shall declare the powers of the Lord? who shall set forth all his praises?</p>
            <p data-verse="106:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do justice at all times.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Remember us, O Lord, in the favour of thy people: visit us with thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That we may see the good of thy chosen, that we may rejoice in the joy of thy nation: that thou mayst be praised with thy inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> We have sinned with our fathers: we have acted unjustly, we have wrought iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt: they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies: And they provoked to wrath going up to the sea, even the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he saved them for his own name's sake: that he might make his power known.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: and he led them through the depths, as in a wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he saved them from the hand of them that hated them: and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the water covered them that afflicted them: there was not one of them left.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they believed his words: and they sang his praises.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They had quickly done, they forgot his works: and they waited not for his counsels.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they coveted their desire in the desert: and they tempted God in the place without water.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he gave them their request: and sent fulness into their souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they provoked Moses in the camp, Aaron the holy one of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan: and covered the congregation of Abiron.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And a fire was kindled in their congregation: the flame burned the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They made also a calf in Horeb: and they adored the graven thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they changed their glory into the likeness of a calf that eateth grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They forgot God, who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="106:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> wondrous works in the land of Cham: terrible things in the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said that he would destroy them: had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they set at nought the desirable land. They believed not his word,</p>
            <p data-verse="106:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> and they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he lifted up his hand over them: to overthrow them in the desert;</p>
            <p data-verse="106:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They also were initiated to Beelphegor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they provoked him with their inventions: and destruction was multiplied among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then Phinees stood up, and pacified him: and the slaughter ceased.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And it was reputed to him unto justice, to generation and generation for evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> They provoked him also at the waters of contradiction: and Moses was afflicted for their sakes:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> because they exasperated his spirit. And he distinguished with his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> They did not destroy the nations of which the Lord spoke unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> and served their idols, and it became a stumblingblock to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they sacrificed their sons, and their daughters to devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And they shed innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan. And the land was polluted with blood,</p>
            <p data-verse="106:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> and was defiled with their works: and they went aside after their own inventions.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And the Lord was exceedingly angry with his people: and he abhorred his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he delivered them into the hands of the nations: and they that hated them had dominion over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And their enemies afflicted them: and they were humbled under their hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> many times did he deliver them. But they provoked him with their counsel: and they were brought low by their iniquities.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he saw when they were in tribulation: and he heard their prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he was mindful of his covenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he gave them unto mercies, in the sight of all those that had made them captives.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Save us, O Lord, our God: and gather us from among nations: That we may give thanks to thy holy name, and may glory in thy praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say: So be it, so be it.</p>

            <p data-verse="106:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="106:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
            <p data-verse="106:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
            <p data-verse="106:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="106:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
