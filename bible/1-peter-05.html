            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech, who am myself also an ancient, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ: as also a partaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not by constraint, but willingly, according to God: not for filthy lucre's sake, but voluntarily:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Neither as lording it over the clergy, but being made a pattern of the flock from the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a never fading crown of glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients. And do you all insinuate humility one to another, for God resisteth the proud, but to the humble he giveth grace.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be sober and watch: because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Whom resist ye, strong in faith: knowing that the same affliction befalls your brethren who are in the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself perfect you, and confirm you, and establish you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have written briefly: beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein you stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you: and so doth my son Mark.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>

            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</p>
