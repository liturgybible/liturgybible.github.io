            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Pharao's chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea: his chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The depths have covered them, they are sunk to the bottom like a stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thy right hand, O Lord, is magnified in strength: thy right hand, O Lord, hath slain the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And in the multitude of they glory thou hast put down thy adversaries: thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured them like stubble.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And with the blast of thy anger the waters were gathered together: the flowing water stood, the depth were gathered together in the midst of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The enemy said: I will pursue and overtake, I will divide the spoils, my soul shall have its fill: I will draw my sword, my hand shall slay them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thy wind blew and the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth swallowed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people which thou hast redeemed: and in thy strength thou hast carried them to thy holy habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nations rose up, and were angry: sorrows took hold on the inhabitants of Philisthiim.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then were the princes of Edom troubled, trembling seized on the stout men of Moab: all the inhabitants of Chanaan became stiff.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let fear and dread fall upon them, in the greatness of thy arm: let them become unmoveable as a stone, until thy people, O Lord, pass by: until this thy people pass by, which thou hast possessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in thy most firm habitation which thou hast made, O Lord; thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For Pharao went in on horseback with his chariots and horsemen into the sea: and the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea: but the children of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So Mary the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand: and all the women went forth after her with timbrels and with dances:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And she began the song to them, saying: Let us sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and his rider he hath thrown into the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went forth into the wilderness of Sur: and they marched three days through the wilderness, and found no water.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they came into Mara, and they could not drink the waters of Mara, because they were bitter: whereupon he gave a name also agreeable to the place, calling it Mara, that is, bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the people murmured against Moses, saying: What shall we drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But he cried to the Lord, and he shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into sweetness. There he appointed him ordinances, and judgments, and there he proved him,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Saying: If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and do what is right before him, and obey his commandments, and keep all his precepts, none of the evils that I laid upon Egypt, will I bring upon thee: for I am the Lord thy healer.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the children of Israel came into Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped by the waters.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,</p>

            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</p>
