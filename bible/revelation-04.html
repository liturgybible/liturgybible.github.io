            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of glass like to crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the first living creature was like a lion: and the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an eagle flying.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the four living creatures had each of them six wings; and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour, and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever;</p>
