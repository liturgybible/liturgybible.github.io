            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But having suffered many things before, and been shamefully treated (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who proveth our hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For neither have we used, at any time, the speech of flattery, as you know; nor taken an occasion of covetousness, God is witness:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others. 7 Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and without blame, we have been to you that have believed:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you, (as a father doth his children,)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> We testified to every one of you, that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own coutrymen, even as they have from the Jews,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For you are our glory and joy.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</p>
