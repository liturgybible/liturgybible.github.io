            <p data-verse="43:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The pride of the height, the clear firmament, the beauty of heaven, with his glorious shew;</p>
            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The sun when it appeareth, declaring at his rising a marvellous instrument, the work of the most High:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> At noon it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heat thereof?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the sun burneth the mountains three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending forth bright beams, it dimmeth the eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Great is the Lord that made it; and at his commandment runneth hastily.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He made the moon also to serve in her season for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> From the moon is the sign of feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven;</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars, an ornament giving light in the highest places of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> At the commandment of the Holy One they will stand in their order, and never faint in their watches.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Look upon the rainbow, and praise him that made it; very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> It compasseth the heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most High have bended it.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall aplace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Through this the treasures are opened: and clouds fly forth as fowls.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By his great power he maketh the clouds firm, and the hailstones are broken small.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> At his sight the mountains are shaken, and at his will the south wind bloweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the northern storm and the whirlwind: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grasshoppers:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The eye marvelleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The hoarfrost also as salt he poureth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the top of sharp stakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> When the cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into ice, it abideth upon every gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a breastplate.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> It devoureth the mountains, and burneth the wilderness, and consumeth the grass as fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A present remedy of all is a mist coming speedily, a dew coming after heat refresheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> By his counsel he appeaseth the deep, and planteth islands therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They that sail on the sea tell of the danger thereof; and when we hear it with our ears, we marvel thereat.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For therein be strange and wondrous works, variety of all kinds of beasts and whales created.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> By him the end of them hath prosperous success, and by his word all things consist.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We may speak much, and yet come short: wherefore in sum, he is all.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> How shall we be able to magnify him? for he is great above all his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The Lord is terrible and very great, and marvellous is his power.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> When ye glorify the Lord, exalt him as much as ye can; for even yet will he far exceed: and when ye exalt him, put forth all your strength, and be not weary; for ye can never go far enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who hath seen him, that he might tell us? and who can magnify him as he is?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> There are yet hid greater things than these be, for we have seen but a few of his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For the Lord hath made all things; and to the godly hath he given wisdom.</p>
