            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow strange gods, which thou knowest not, and let us serve them:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer: for the Lord your God trieth you, that it may appear whether you love him with all your heart, and with all your soul, or not.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and hear his voice: him you shall serve, and to him you shall cleave.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And that prophet or forger of dreams shall be slain: because he spoke to draw you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage: to make thee go out of the way, which the Lord thy God commanded thee: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou shalt forthwith kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it, even the cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And all the household goods that are there, thou shalt gather together in the midst of the streets thereof, and shalt burn them with the city itself, so as to consume all for the Lord thy God, and that it be a heap for ever: it shall be built no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And there shall nothing of that anathema stick to thy hand: that the Lord may turn from the wrath of his fury, and may have mercy on thee, and multiply thee as he swore to thy fathers,</p>
