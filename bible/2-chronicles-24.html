            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Joas was seven years old when he began to reign: and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem : the name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which is good before the Lord all the days of Joiada the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joiada took for him two wives, by whom he had sons and daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> After this Joas had a mind to repair the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he assembled the priests, and the Levites, and said to them: Go out to the cities of Juda, and gather of all Israel money to repair the temple of your God, from year to year: and do this with speed: but the Levites were negligent.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king called Joiada the chief, and said to him: Why hast thou not taken care to oblige the Levites to bring in out of Juda and Jerusalem the money that was appointed by Moses the servant of the Lord for all the multitude of Israel to bring into the tabernacle of the testimony?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For that wicked woman Athalia, and her children have destroyed the house of God, and adorned the temple of Baal with all the things that had been dedicated in the temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the king commanded, and they made a chest: and set it by the gate of the house of the Lord on the outside.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they made a proclamation in Juda and Jerusalem, that every man should bring to the Lord the money which Moses the servant of God appointed for all Israel, in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the princes, and all the people rejoiced: and going In they contributed and cast so much into the chest of the Lord, that it was filled.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the hands of the Levites, (for they saw there was much money,) the king's scribe, and he whom the high priest had appointed went in: and they poured out the money that was in the chest: and they carried back the chest to its place: and thus they did from day to day, and there was gathered an immense sum of money.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king and Joiada gave it to those who were over the works of the house of the Lord: but they hired with it stonecutters, and artificers of every kind of work to repair the house of the Lord: and such as wrought in iron and brass, to uphold what began to be falling.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the workmen were diligent, and the breach of the walls was closed up by their hands, and they set up the house of the Lord in its former state, and made it stand firm.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when they had finished all the works, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Joiada: and with it were made vessels for the temple for the ministry, and for holocausts and bowls, and other vessels of gold and silver : and holocausts were offered in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Joiada.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Joiada grew old and was full of days, and died when he was a hundred and thirty years old.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good to Israel, and to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And after the death of Joiada, the princes of Juda went in, and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services and hearkened to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they forsook the temple of the Lord the God of their fathers, and served groves and idols, and wrath came upon Juda and Jerusalem for this sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord, and they would not give ear when they testified against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The spirit of God then came upon Zacharias the son of Joiada the priest, and he stood in the sight of the people, and said to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Why transgress you the commandment of the Lord which will not be for your good, and have forsaken the Lord, to make him forsake you?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they gathered themselves together against him, and stoned him at the king's commandment in the court of the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And king Joas did not remember the kindness that Joiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died, he said: The Lord see, and require it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when a year was come about, the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Juda and Jerusalem, end killed all the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king of Damascus.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And whereas there came a very small number of the Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers: and on Joas they executed shameful judgments.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And departing they left him in diseases: and his servants rose up him, for revenge of the blood of the son of Joiada the priest, and they slew him in his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now the men that conspired against him were Zabad the son of Semmaath an Ammonitess, and Jozabad the son of Semarith a Moabitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And concerning his sons, and the sum of money which was gathered under him, and the repairing the house of God; they are written more diligently in the book of kings: and Amasias his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
