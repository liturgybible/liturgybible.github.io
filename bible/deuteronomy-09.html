            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear, O Israel: Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day; to possess nations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities great, and walled up to the sky,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A People great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast seen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he hath spoken to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because they have done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in: and that the Lord might accomplish his word, which he promised by oath to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very stiffnecked people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember, and forget not how then provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou camest out of Egypt unto this place, thou hast always strove against the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For in Horeb also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and would have destroyed thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you: and I continued in the mount forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking water.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the Are, when the people were assembled together.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly: for thy people, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly forsaken the way that thou hast shewn them, and have made to themselves a molten idol.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And again the Lord said to me: I see that this people is stiffnecked:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from under heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater and stronger than this.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two tables of the covenant with both hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way, which he had shewn you:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I fell down before the Lord se before, forty days and nights neither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you had committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to wrath:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And the Lord heard me this time also.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have destroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the graves of lust you provoked the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying: Go up, and possess the land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the Lord your God, and did not believe him, neither would you hearken to his voice:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights, in which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had threatened:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And praying, I said: 0 Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: look not on the stubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast brought us, say: The Lord could not bring them into the land that he promised them, and he hated them: therefore he brought them out, that he might kill them in the wilderness,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</p>
