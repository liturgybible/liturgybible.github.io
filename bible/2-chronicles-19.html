            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer met him, and said to him: Thou helpest the ungodly, and thou art joined in friendship with them that hate the Lord, and therefore thou didst deserve indeed the wrath of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But good works are found in thee, because thou hast taken away the groves out of the land of Juda, and hast prepared thy heart to seek the Lord the God of thy fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Josaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again to the people from Bersabee to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he set judges of the land in all the fenced cities of Juda, in every place.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And charging the judges, he said: Take heed what you do: for you exercise not the judgment of man, but of the Lord: and whatsoever you judge, it shall redound to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and do all things with diligence: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, a nor respect of persons, nor desire of gifts.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In Jerusalem also Josaphat appointed Levites, and priests and chiefs of the families of Israel, to judge the judgment and the cause of the Lord for the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he charged them, saying: Thus shall you do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Every cause that shall come to you of your brethren, that dwell in their cities, between kindred and kindred, wheresoever there is question concerning the law, the commandment, the ceremonies, the justifications: shew it them, that they may not sin against the Lord, and that wrath may not come upon you and your brethren: and so doing you shall not sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Amarias the priest your high priest shell be chief in the things which regard God: and Zabadias the son of Ismahel, who is ruler in the house of Juda, shall be over those matters which belong to the king's office : and you have before you the Levites for masters, take courage and do diligently, and the Lord will be with you in good things.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.</p>
