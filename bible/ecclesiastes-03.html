            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What hath man more of his labour?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to their consideration, so that man cannot flnd out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do well in this life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For every man that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his labour, this is the gift of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever: we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made that he may be feared.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That which hath been made, the same continueth: the things that shall be, have already been: and God restoreth that which is past.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in the place of justice iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and then shall be the time of every thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would prove them, and shew them to be like beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the condition of them both is equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And all things go to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they return together.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward, and if the spirit of the beasts descend downward?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work, and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that shall be after him?</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>

            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
