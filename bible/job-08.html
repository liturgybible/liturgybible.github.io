            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake onto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Insomuch, that if thy former things were small, thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow:)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Can the rush be green without moisture? or a sedge-bush grow without water?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spider's web.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh, and at his rising his blossom shall shoot forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones, and among the stones he shall abide.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evildoer:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider’s web.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</p>
