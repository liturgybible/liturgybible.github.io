            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p>

            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</p>
