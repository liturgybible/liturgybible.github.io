            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.</p>
