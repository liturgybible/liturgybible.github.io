            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one and thirty years in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father: he declined not, neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And in the eighth year of his reign, when he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David: and in the twelfth year after he began to reign, he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the idols, and the graven things.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they broke down before him the altars of Baalim, and demolished the idols that had been set upon them: and be cut down the groves and the graven things, and broke them in pieces: and strewed the fragments upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he burnt the bones of the priests on the altars of the idols, and he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the cities of Manasses, and of Ephraim, and of Simeon, even to Nephtali he demolished all.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he had destroyed the altars, and the groves, and had broken the idols in pieces, and had demolished all profane temples throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had cleansed the land, and the temple of the Lord, he sent Saphan the son of Eselias, and Maasias the governor of the city, Joha the son of Joachaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they came to Helcias the high priest: and received of him the money which had been brought into the house of the Lord, and which the Levites and porters had gathered together from Manasses, and Ephraim, and all the remnant of Israel, and from all Juda, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Which they delivered into the hands of them that were over the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the temple, and mend all that was weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But they gave it to the artificers, and to the masons, to buy stones out of the quarries, and timber for the couplings of the building, and to rafter the houses, which the kings of Juda had destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they did all faithfully. Now the overseers of the workmen were Jahath and Abdias of the sons of Merari, Zacharias and Mosollam of the sons of Caath, who hastened the work: all Levites skilful to play on instruments.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But over them that carried burdens for divers uses, were scribes, and masters of the number of the Levites, and porters.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now when they carried out the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord, Helcias the priest found the book of the law of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to Saphan the scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord: and he delivered it to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But he carried the book to the king, and told him, saying: Lo, all that thou hast committed to thy servants, is accomplished.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They have gathered together the silver that was found in the house of the Lord: and it is given to the overseers of the artificers, and of the workmen, for divers works.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Moreover Helcias the priest gave me this book. And he read it before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when he had heard the words of the law, he rent his garments:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he commanded Helcias, and Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Abdon the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaa the king's servant, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> ,21Go, and pray to the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel, and Juda, concerning all the words of this book, which is found: for the great wrath of the Lord hath fallen upon us, because our fathers have not kept the words of the Lord, to do all things that are written in this book.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Helcias and they that were sent with him by the king, went to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellum the son of Thecuath, the son of Hasra keeper of the wardrobe: who dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second part: and they spoke to her the words above mentioned.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And she answered them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring evils upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, and all the curses that are written in this book which they read before the king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath shall fall upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But as to the king of Juda that sent you to beseech the Lord, thus shall you say to him: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Because thou hast heard the words of this book,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thy heart was softened. and thou hast humbled thyself in the sight of God for the things that are spoken against this place, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and reverencing my face, hast rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For now I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be brought to thy tomb in peace: and thy eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and the inhabitants thereof. They therefore reported to the king all that she had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he called together all the ancients of Juda and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And went up to the house of the Lord, and all the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, and all the people from the least to the greatest. And the king read in their hearing, in the house of the Lord, all the words of the book.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And standing up in his tribunal, he made a covenant before the Lord to walk after him, and keep his commandments, and testimonies, and justifications with all his heart, and with all his soul, and to do the things that were written in that book which he had read.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he adjured all that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to do the same: and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Josias took away all the abominations out of all the countries of the children of Israel: and made all that were left in Israel, to serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived they departed not from the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>

            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king’s, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p>
