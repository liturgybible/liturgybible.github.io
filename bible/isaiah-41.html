            <p data-verse="41:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who hath raised up the just one from the east, hath called him to follow him? he shall give the nations in his sight, and he shall rule over kings: he shall give them as the dust to his sword, as stubble driven by the wind, to his bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He shall pursue them, he shall pass in peace, no path shall appear after his feet.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who bath declared from the beginning, that we may know: and from time of old, that we may say: Thou art just. There is none that sheweth, nor that foretelleth, nor that heareth your words.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The first shall say to Sion: Behold they are here, and to Jerusalem I will give an evangelist.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I saw, and there was no one even among them to consult, or who, when I asked, could answer a word.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Behold they are all in the wrong, and their works are vain: their idols are wind and vanity.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.</p>
