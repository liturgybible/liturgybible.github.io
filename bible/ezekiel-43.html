            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And behold the glory of the God of Israel came in by the way of the east: and his voice was like the noise of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I saw the vision according to the appearance which I had seen when he came to destroy the city: and the appearance was according to the vision which I had seen by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the majesty of the Lord went into the temple by the way of the gate that looked to the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court: and behold the house was filled with the glory of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and the man that stood by me,</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Said to me: Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever: and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their kings by their fornications, and by the carcasses of their kings, and by the high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They who have set their threshold by my threshold, and their posts by my posts: and there was but a wall between me and them: and they profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed: for which reason I consumed them in my wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore let them put away their fornications, and the carcasses of their kings far from me: and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But thou, son of man, shew to the house of Israel the temple, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the building:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And be ashamed of all that they have done. Shew them the form of the house, and of the fashion thereof, the goings out and the comings in, and the whole plan thereof, and all its ordinances, and all its order, and all its laws, and thou shalt write it in their sight: that they may keep the whole form thereof, and its ordinances, and do them.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And from the bottom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits, and the breadth of one cubit: and from the lesser brim to the greater brim four cubits, and the breadth of one cubit.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And thou shalt take the calf, that is offered for sin: and thou shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And in the second day thou shalt offer a he goat without blemish for sin: and they shall expiate the altar, as they expiated it with the calf.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when thou shalt have made an end of the expiation thereof, thou shalt offer a calf of the herd without blemish, and a ram of the flock without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And thou shalt offer them in the sight of the Lord: and the priests shall put salt upon them, and shall offer them a holocaust to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Seven days shalt thou offer a he goat for sill daily: they shall offer also a calf of the herd, and a ram of the flock without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Seven days shall they expiate the altar, and shall cleanse it: and they shall consecrate it.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the days being, expired, on the eighth day and thenceforward, the priests shall offer your holocausts upon the altar, and the peace offerings: and I will be pacified towards you, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.</p>

            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
