            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army, to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for Israel's sake, and I am left alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan thy brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Saying: We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money that he owed in the king's account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him, nevertheless he ordered the money, and the children to be sent: lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Because he sent not the money, and the children, therefore is he lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after this Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place whithersoever they went.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and sent them victuals.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, in the city of his fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone behind and before:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his father and his mother, and his four brethren:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And round about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars arms for a perpetual memory: and by the arms ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king Antiochus, treacherously slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land: for all that Tryphon did was to spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And king Demetrius in answer to this request, wrote a letter in this manner:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> For all that we have decreed in your favour, shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon the high priest, the great captain and prince of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And they that were within the engine leaped into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Simon being moved, did not destroy them: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And they cried to Simon form peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from uncleannesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.</p>
