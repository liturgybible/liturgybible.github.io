            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land of Chanaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Dividing all by lot, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession beyond the Jordan: besides the Levites, who received no land among their brethren:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the Levites receive other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and their suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel, and they divided the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite spoke to him: Thou knowest what the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadesbarne.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I was forty Bears old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me m from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word again as to me seemed true.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged the heart of the people: and I nevertheless followed the Lord my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses swore in that day, saying: The land which thy foot hath trodden upon shall be thy possession, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast followed the Lord my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised until this present day. It is forty and five years since the Lord spoke this word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the wilderness: this day I am eighty-five years old,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view the land : the strength of that time continueth in me until this day, as well to fight as to march.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised, in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and strong: if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to destroy them, as he promised me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, until this present day: because he followed the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The name of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: Adam the greatest among the Enacims was laid there: and the land rested from wars.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</p>
