            <p data-verse="47:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan: and behold they stay in the land of Gessen.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Five men also the last of his brethren, he presented before the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he asked them: What is your occupation? They answered: Re thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be in the land of Gessen.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The land of Egypt is before thee: make them dwell in the best place, and give them the land of Gessen. And if thou knowest that there are industrious men among them, make them rulers over my cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> After this Joseph brought in his to the king, and presented him before him: and he blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?</p>
            <p data-verse="47:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And blessing the king, he went out.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses, as Pharao had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he nourished them, and all his father's house, allowing food to every one.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had op- pressed the land: more especially of Egypt and Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they bought, and brought it into the king's treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now net money.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he answered them: Bring your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, end asses and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thins, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the other end thereof,</p>
            <p data-verse="47:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then Joseph said to the people : Be- hold as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao: take seed and sow the fields,</p>
            <p data-verse="47:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king: the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the king, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed it: and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But I will sleep with my fathers, end thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's head.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="47:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="47:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="47:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="47:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.</p>
