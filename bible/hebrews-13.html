            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day; and the same for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices God's favour is obtained.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
