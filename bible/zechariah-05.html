            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I see a volume flying: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said to me: This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the earth: for every thief shall be judged as is there written: and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be judged by it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts: and it shall come to the house of the thief, and to the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the angel went forth that spoke in me, and he said to me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth forth.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said: This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the earth and the heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I said to the angel that spoke in me: Whither do these carry the vessel?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there upon its own basis.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.</p>
