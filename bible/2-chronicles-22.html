            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son king in his place: for the rovers of the Arabians, who had broke in upon the camp, had killed all that were his elder brothers. So Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda reigned.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ochozias was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house of Achab: for his mother pushed him on to do wickedly.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Achab did: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he walked after their counsels. And he went with Joram the son of Achab king of Israel, to fight against Hazael king of Syria, at Ramoth Galaad : and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he returned to be healed in Jezrahel: for he received many wounds in the foresaid battle. And Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel where he lay sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For it was the will of God against Ochozias that he should come to Joram: and when he was come should go out also against Jehu the son of Namsi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Achab.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So when Jehu was rooting out the house of Achab, he found the princes of Juda, and the sons of the brethren of Ochozias, who served him, and he slew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he sought for Ochozias himself, and took him lying hid in Samaria: and when he was brought to him, he killed him, and they buried him: because he was the son of Josaphat, who had sought the Lord with all his heart. And there was no more hope that any one should reign of the race of Ochozias.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For Athalia his mother, seeing that her son was dead, rose up, and killed all the royal family of the house of Joram.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Josabeth the king's daughter took Joas the son of Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain. And she hid him with his nurse in a bedchamber: now Josabeth that hid him, was daughter of king Joram, wife of Joiada the high priest, and sister of Ochozias, and therefore Athalia did not kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years, during which Athalia reigned over the land.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</p>
