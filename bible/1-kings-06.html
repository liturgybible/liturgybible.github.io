            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon over Israel, in the month Zio (the same is the second month), he began to build a house to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the house, which king Solomon built to the Lord, was threescore cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there was a porch before the temple of twenty cubits in length, according to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it was ten cubits in breadth before the face of the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he made in the temple oblique windows.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And upon the wall of the temple he built floors round about, in the walls of the house round about the temple and the oracle, and he made sides round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The floor that was underneath, was five cubits in breadth, and the middle floor was six cubits in breadth, and the third door was seven cubits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not be fastened in the walls of the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in building.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The door for the middle side was on the right hand of the house : and by winding stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the third.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So he built the house, and finished it: end he covered the house with roofs of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he built a floor over all the house five cubits in height, and he covered the house with timber of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> This house, which thou buildest, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments, walking in them, I will fulfil my word to thee which I spoke to David thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Solomon built the house and finished it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roots, he covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder part of the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle to be the holy of holies.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the temple itself before the doors of the oracle was forty cubits long.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all the house was covered within with cedar, having the turnings, and the joints thereof artfully wrought and carvings projecting out: all was covered with boards of cedar: and no stone could be seen in the wall at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered and overlaid it with most pure gold. And the altar also he covered with cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold, and fastened on the plates with nails of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with gold: the whole altar of the oracle he covered also with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he made in the oracle two cherubims of olive tree, of ten cubits in height.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity of one wing to the extremity of the other wing.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was the same in both the cherubims:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubims stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in the midst of the temple touched one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And in the entrance of the oracle he made little doors of olive tree, and posts of five corners,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And two doors of olive tree: and he carved upon them figures of cherubims, and figures of palm trees, and carvings very much projecting: and he overlaid them with gold: and he covered both the cherubims and the palm trees, and the other things with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olive tree foursquare:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And two doors of fir tree, one of each side : and each door was double, and so opened with folding leaves.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he carved cherubims, and palm trees, and carved work standing very much out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by rule.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he built the inner court with three rows of polished stones, and one row of beams of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> In the fourth year was the house of the Lord founded in the month Zio:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And in the eleventh year in the month Bul (which is the eighth month) the house was finished in all the works thereof, and in all the appurtenances thereof: and he was seven years in building it.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</p>
