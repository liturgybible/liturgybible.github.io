            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Six days shall ye do work: the seventh day, because it is the rest of the sabbath, shall be called holy. You shall do no work on that day: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your habitations.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> These also are the holy days of the Lord, which you must celebrate in their seasons.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the fifteenth day of the same month is the solemnity of the unleavened bread of the Lord. Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The first day shall be most solemn unto you, and holy: you shall do no servile work therein:</p>

            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, and shall reap your corn, you shall bring sheaves of ears, the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who shall lift up the shed before the Lord, the next day after the sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you, and shall sanctify it.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And on the same day that the sheaf is consecrated, a lamb without blemish of the first year shall be killed for a holocaust of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the libations shall be offered with it, two tenths of hour tempered with oil for a burnt offering of the Lord, and a most sweet odour: libations also of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> You shall not eat either bread, or parched corn, or frumenty of the harvest, until the day that you shall offer thereof to your God. It is a precept for ever throughout your generations, and all your dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> You shall count therefore from the morrow after the sabbath, wherein you offered the sheaf of the firstfruits, seven full weeks.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And you shall offer with the leaves seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one calf from the herd, and two rams, and they shall be for a holocaust with their libations far a most sweet odour to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> You shall offer also a buck goat for sin, and two lambs of the first year for sacrifices of peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when the priest hath lifted them up with the leaves of the firstfruits before the Lord, they shall fall to his use.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> You shall do no work therefore on that day: it shall be an everlasting ordinance unto you in all your generations, and dwellings.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call most solemn and most holy, and shall offer on them oblations to the Lord, holocausts and libations according to the rite of every day,</p>
