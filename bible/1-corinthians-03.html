            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, ate one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are God's building.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Let no man therefore glory in men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>

            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
