            <p data-verse="50:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's face weeping and kissing him.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And while they were fulfilling his commands, there passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that were embalmed, and Egypt mounted for him seventy days.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have found favour in your sight, speak in the ears of Pharao:</p>
            <p data-verse="50:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I die: thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for myself in the land of Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my father, and return.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="50:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in the land of Gessen.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and it was it great company.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And there- fore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought together with the held for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the Hethite over against Mambre.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,</p>
            <p data-verse="50:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practiced against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And his brethren came to him: and worshipping prostrate on the ground they said: We are thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="50:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house: and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Ma-nasses were born on Joseph's knees.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> After which he told his brethren: God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit you, Carry my bones with you out of this place:</p>
            <p data-verse="50:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he died being a hundred and ten years old. And being embalmed he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</p>

            <p data-verse="50:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="50:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="50:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>
            <p data-verse="50:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="50:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="50:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>
            <p data-verse="50:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
