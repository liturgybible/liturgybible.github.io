            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when king Sedecias sent unto him Phassur, the son of Melchias, and Sophonias, the son of Maasias the priest, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon maketh war against us: if so be the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful works, that he may depart from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jeremias said to them: Thus shall you say to Sedecias:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, that besiege you round about the walls: and I will gather them together in the midst of this city.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and in great wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, men and beasts shall die of a great pestilence.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, and the sword , and the famine, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword, and he shall not be moved to pity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy on them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And to this people thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that shall go out and flee over to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and his life shall be to him as a spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And to the house of the king of Juda: Hear ye the word of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> O house of David, this saith the Lord: Judge ye judgement in the morning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the hand of the oppressor: lest my indignation go forth like a fire, and be kindled, and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your ways.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</p>

            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</p>
