            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into which he scattered thee before.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from thence,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it: and blessing thee, he will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed: that then mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, that thou mayst live.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them that hate and persecute thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things. For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he rejoiced in thy fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law: and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above thee, nor far off from thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say: Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil it in work?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Nor is it beyond the sea: that thou mayst excuse thyself, and say: Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us: that we may hear, and do that which is commanded?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and thou mayst live, and he may multiply thee, and bless thee in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and shalt remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee:</p>

            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</p>

            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</p>
