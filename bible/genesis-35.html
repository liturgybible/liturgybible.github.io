            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jacob having called together all his household, said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be cleansed and change your garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make there an altar to God: who heard me in the day of my affliction, and accompanied me in my journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of Sichem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when they were departed, the terror of God fell upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue after them as they went away.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he built there an altar, and called the name of that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him when he fled from his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> At the same time Debora the nurse of Rebecca died, and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak: and the name of that place was called, The oak of weeping.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. And he called him Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And said to him: I am God Almighty, increase thou and be multiplied. Nations and peoples of nations shall be from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where God had spoken to him: pouring drink offerings upon it, and pouring oil thereon:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And calling the name of that place Bethel.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And going forth from thence, he came in the springtime to the land which leadeth to Ephrata: wherein when Rachel was in travail,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> By reason of her hard labor she began to be in danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt have this son also.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when her soul was departing for pain, and death was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that is, The son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin, that is, The son of the right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that leadeth to Ephrata, that is Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulcher: this is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the Flock tower.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and slept with Bala, the concubine of his father: which he was not ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The sons of Lia: Ruben the firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and Zebulon.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphthali.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad and Aser: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Mesopotamia of Syria.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre, the city of Arbee, this is Hebron: Wherein Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
