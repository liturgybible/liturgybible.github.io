            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wisdom shall praise herself, and shall glory in the midst of her people.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the congregation of the most High shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I came out of the mouth of the most High, and covered the earth as a cloud.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the waves of the sea and in all the earth, and in every people and nation, I got a possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So the Creator of all things gave me a commandment, and he that made me caused my tabernacle to rest, and said, Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thine inheritance in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He created me from the beginning before the world, and I shall never fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In the holy tabernacle I served before him; and so was I established in Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Likewise in the beloved city he gave me rest, and in Jerusalem was my power.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I took root in an honourable people, even in the portion of the Lord’s inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree upon the mountains of Hermon.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I was exalted like a palm tree in En-gaddi, and as a rose plant in Jericho, as a fair olive tree in a pleasant field, and grew up as a plane tree by the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon and aspalathus, and I yielded a pleasant odour like the best myrrh, as galbanum, and onyx, and sweet storax, and as the fume of frankincense in the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As the turpentine tree I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> As the vine brought I forth pleasant savour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I am the mother of fair love, and fear, and knowledge, and holy hope: I therefore, being eternal, am given to all my children which are named of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Come unto me, all ye that be desirous of me, and fill yourselves with my fruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For my memorial is sweeter than honey, and mine inheritance than the honeycomb.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me shall yet be thirsty.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He that obeyeth me shall never be confounded, and they that work by me shall not do amiss.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these things are the book of the covenant of the most high God, even the law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Faint not to be strong in the Lord; that he may confirm you, cleave unto him: for the Lord Almighty is God alone, and beside him there is no other Saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He filleth all things with his wisdom, as Phison and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He maketh the understanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Jordan in the time of the harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appear as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last find her out.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For her thoughts are more than the sea, and her counsels profounder than the great deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bed: and, lo, my brook became a river, and my river became a sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and leave it to all ages for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Behold that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all them that seek wisdom.</p>
