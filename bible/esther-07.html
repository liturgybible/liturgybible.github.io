            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm with wine: What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee? and what wilt thou have done: although thou ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then she answered: If I have found Favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people for which I request.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. And would God we were sold for bondmen and bondwomen: the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in silence: but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And king Assuerus answered and said: Who is this, and of what power, that he should do these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Esther said: It is this Aman that is our adversary and most wicked enemy. Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being able to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the banquet into the garden set with trees. Aman also rose up to entreat Esther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared for him by the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and entered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon the bed on which Esther lay, and he said: He will force the queen also in my presence, in my own house. The word was not yet gone out of the king's mouth, and immediately they covered his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king, said: Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke for the king, standeth in Aman's house, being fifty cubits high. And the king said to him: Hang him upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for Mardochai: and the king's wrath ceased.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king’s damage.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath pacified.</p>
