            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said to his sons: Why are ye careless?</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: go ye down, and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed with want.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn in Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But they said: It is not so, my lord, but thy servants are come to buy food.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the unfenced parts of this land.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He saith: This is it that I said: You are spies.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao you shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So he put them in prison three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison: and go ye your ways and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things, because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguished of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Ruben one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do not sin against the boy: and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them by an interpreter.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning he spoke to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And taking Simeon, and binking him in their presence, he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions for the way: and they did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But they having loaded their asses with the corn, went their way.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth;</p>
            <p data-verse="42:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And said to his brethren: My money is given me again, hehold it is in the sack. And thye were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?</p>
            <p data-verse="42:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> When they had told this, they poured out their corn and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons if I bring him not again to thee: deliver him unto my hand, and I will restore him to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to hell.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?</p>
            <p data-verse="42:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="42:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
