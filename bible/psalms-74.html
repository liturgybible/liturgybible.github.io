            <p data-verse="74:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="74:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="74:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up their ensigns for signs,</p>
            <p data-verse="74:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> and they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees,</p>
            <p data-verse="74:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> they have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.</p>
            <p data-verse="74:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="74:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land.</p>

            <p data-verse="74:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>

            <p data-verse="74:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniquity.</p>
