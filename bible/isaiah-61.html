            <p data-verse="61:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God: to comfort all that mourn:</p>

            <p data-verse="61:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they shall build the places that have been waste from of old, and shall raise up ancient ruins, and shall repair the desolate cities, that were destroyed for generation and generation.</p>

            <p data-verse="61:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth her seed to shoot forth: so shall the Lord God make justice to spring forth, and praise before all the nations.</p>
