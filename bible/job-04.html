            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it ill, but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened the weary hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest: it hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the perfection of thy ways?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? or when were the just destroyed?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> On the contrary I have seen those who work iniquity, and sow sorrows, and reap them,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit of his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of the whelps of lions are broken:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young lions are scattered abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears by stealth as it were received the veins of its whisper.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is wont to hold men,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were affrighted:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh stood up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image before my eyes, and I heard the voice as it were of a gentle wind:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay, who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the moth?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and because no one understandeth, they shall perish for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from them: they shall die, and not in wisdom.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>
