            <p data-verse="42:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to sin thereby:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly;</p>
            <p data-verse="42:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends;</p>
            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Of exactness of balance and weights; or of getting much or little;</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And of merchants’ indifferent selling; of much correction of children; and to make the side of an evil servant to bleed.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Sure keeping is good, where an evil wife is; and shut up, where many hands are.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Deliver all things in number and weight; and put all in writing that thou givest out, or receivest in.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the extreme aged that contendeth with those that are young: thus shalt thou be truly learned, and approved of all men living.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The father waketh for the daughter, when no man knoweth; and the care for her taketh away sleep: when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age; and being married, lest she should be hated:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In her virginity, lest she should be defiled and gotten with child in her father’s house; and having an husband, lest she should misbehave herself; and when she is married, lest she should be barren.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter, lest she make thee a laughingstock to thine enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold not every body’s beauty, and sit not in the midst of women.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For from garments cometh a moth, and from women wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Better is the churlishness of a man than a courteous woman, a woman, I say, which bringeth shame and reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I have seen: In the words of the Lord are his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The sun that giveth light looketh upon all things, and the work thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Lord hath not given power to the saints to declare all his marvellous works, which the Almighty Lord firmly settled, that whatsoever is might be established for his glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He seeketh out the deep, and the heart, and considereth their crafty devices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be known, and he beholdeth the signs of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He hath garnished the excellent works of his wisdom, and he is from everlasting to everlasting: unto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Oh how desirable are all his works! and that a man may see even to a spark.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these things live and remain for ever for all uses, and they are all obedient.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> All things are double one against another: and he hath made nothing imperfect.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> One thing establisheth the good or another: and who shall be filled with beholding his glory?</p>
