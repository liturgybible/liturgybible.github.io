            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Amasias was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem, the name of his mother was Joadan of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did what was good in the sight of the Lord: but yet not with a perfect heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he saw himself strengthened in his kingdom, he put to death the servants that had slain the king his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But he slew not their children, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying: The fathers shall not be slain for the children, nor the children for their fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Amasias therefore gathered Juda together, and appointed them by families, and captains of thousands and of hundreds in all Juda, and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards, and found three hundred thousand young men that could go out to battle, and could hold the spear and shield.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He hired also of Israel a hundred thousand valiant men, for a hundred talents of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But a man of God came to him, and said: O king, let not the army of Israel go out with thee, for the Lord is not with Israel, and all the children of Ephraim:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And if thou think that battles consist in the strength of the army, God will make thee to be overcome by the enemies: for it belongeth to God both to help, and to put to flight.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Amasias said to the man of God: What will then become of the hundred talents which I have given to the soldiers of Israeli and the man of God answered him: The Lord is rich enough to be able to give thee much more than this.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Amasias separated the army, that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: but they being much enraged against Juda, returned to their own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Amasias taking courage led forth his people, and went to the vale of saltpits, and slew of the children of Seir ten thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And other ten thousand men the sons of Juda took, and brought to the steep of a certain rock, and cast them down headlong from the top, and they all were broken to pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But that army which Amasias had sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, spread themselves among the cities of Juda, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and having killed three thousand took away much spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But Amasias after he had slain the Edomites, set up the gods of the children of Seir, which he had brought thence, to be his gods, and adored them, and burnt incense to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wherefore the Lord being angry against Amasias, sent a prophet to him, to say to him: Why hast thou adored gods that have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when he spoke these things, he answered him: Art thou the king's counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the prophet departing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because thou hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Amasias king of Juda taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas the son of Joachaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that is in Libanus, sent to the cedar in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the wood of Libanus passed by, and trod down the thistle.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou hast said: I have overthrown Edom, and therefore thy heart is lifted up with pride : stay at home, why dost thou provoke evil against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and Juda with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the Lord's will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So Joas king of Israel went up, and they presented themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias king of Juda was in Bethsames of Juda:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Juda fell before Israel and they fled to their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Joas king of Israel took Amasias king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the treasures of the king's house, moreover also the sons of the hostages, he brought back to Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, fifteen years.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And after he revolted from the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled into Lachis, and they sent, and killed him there.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of David.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</p>
