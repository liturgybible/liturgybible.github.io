            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> (Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 17 The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And many more believed in him because of his own word.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he .</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
