            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetly doth she order all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what is richer than wisdom, that worketh all things?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunning workman than she?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more profitable in their life.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old, and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: she foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me, knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and a comfort in cares and grief.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, and honour with the elders, though I be young.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come after me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall be subject unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear of me; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant in war.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live with her hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now when I considered these things in myself, and pondered them in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom is immortality;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in the works of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise of conference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a good report; I went about seeking how to take her to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwise obtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point of wisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord, and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,</p>
