            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and took to their own use of the anathema. For Achan the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda, took something of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And returning they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go and destroy the city: why should all the people be troubled in vain against enemies that are very few?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There went up therefore three thou- sand fighting men: who immediately turned their backs,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty men : and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground before the ark of the Lord until the evening, both he and all the ancients of Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and to destroy us? would God, we had stayed beyond the Jordan as we began.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord said to Josue: Arise, why liest thou flat on the ground?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hidden it among their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall flee from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye sanctified against to morrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The anathema is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee that is defiled with this wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And you shall come in the morning every one by your tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds and the kindred by its houses, and the house by the men.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt with fire with all his substance, because he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to come by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Which being brought by its families, it was found to be the family of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment exceeding good, and two hundred sides of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sides: and I coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground is the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent, found all hidden in the same place, together with the silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then Josue and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zare, and the silver and the garments, and the golden rule, his sons also and his daughters, his oxen and asses and sheep, the tent also, and all the goods: and brought them to the valley of Achor:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Where Josue said: Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things that were his, were consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day. And the wrath of the Lord was turned away from them. And the name of that place was called the Valley of Achor, until this day.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</p>
