            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the children of Israel had also sworn in Maspha, saying: None of us shall give of his daughters to the children of Benjamin to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they all came to the house of God in Silo, and abiding before him till the evening, lifted up their voices, and began to lament and weep, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> O Lord God of Israel, why is so great an evil come to pass in thy people, that this day one tribe should be taken away from among us?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And rising early the next day, they built an altar: and offered there holocausts, and victims of peace, and they said:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the army of the Lord? for they had bound themselves with a great oath, when they were in Maspha, that whosoever were wanting should be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the children of Israel being moved with repentance for their brother Benjamin, began to say: One tribe is taken away from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Whence shall they take wives? For we have all in general sworn, not to give our daughters to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore they said: Who is thereof all the tribes of Israel, that came not up to the Lord to Maspha. And behold the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> (At that time also when they were in Silo, no one of them was found there.)</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men, and commanded them, saying: Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad to the sword, with their wives and their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is what you shall observe: Every male, and all women that have known men, you shall kill, but the virgins you shall save.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred virgins, that had not known the bed of a man, and they brought them to the camp Silo, into the land of Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they sent messengers to the children of Benjamin, that were in the rock Remmon, and commanded them to receive them in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the children of Benjamin came at that time, and wives were given them of the daughters of Jabes Galaad: but they found no others, whom they might give in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And all Israel was very sorry, and repented for the destroying of one tribe out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the ancients said: What shall we do with the rest, that have not received wives? for all the women in Benjamin are dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And we must use all care, and provide with great diligence, that one tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For as to our own daughters we cannot give them, being bound with an oath and a curse, whereby we said: Cursed be he that shall give Benjamin any of his daughters to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So they took counsel, and said: Behold there is a yearly solemnity of the Lord in Silo, which is situate on the north of the city of Bethel, and on the east side of the way, that goeth from Bethel to Sichem, and on the south of the town of Lebona.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they commanded the children of Benjamin, and said: Go, and lie hid in the vineyards,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come out, as the custom is, to dance, come ye on a sudden out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife among them, and go into the land of Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when their fathers and their brethren shall come, and shall begin to complain against you, and to chide, we will say to them: Have pity on them for they took them not away as by the right of war or conquest, but when they asked to have them, you gave them not, and the fault was committed on your part.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the children of Benjamin did, as they had been commanded: and according to their number, they carried off for themselves every man his wife of them that were dancing: and they went into their possession and built up their cities, and dwelt in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The children of Israel also returned by their tribes, and families, to their dwellings. In those days there was no king in Israel: but every one did that which seemed right to himself.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>
