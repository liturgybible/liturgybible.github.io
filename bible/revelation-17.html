            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven vials, and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication; and they who inhabit the earth, have been made drunk with the whine of her whoredom.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he took me away in spirit into the desert. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery; Babylon the great, the mother of the fornications, and the abominations of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I wondered, when I had seen her, with great admiration.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The beast, which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up out of the bottomless pit, and go into destruction: and the inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was, and is not.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth, and they are seven kings:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come: and when he is come, he must remain a short time.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the beast which was, and is not: the same also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings one hour after the beast.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> These have one design: and their strength and power they shall deliver to the beast.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and they that are with him are called, and elect, and faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and nations, and tongues.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth him: that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the woman which thou sawest, is the great city, which hath kingdom over the kings of the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</p>
