            <p data-verse="65:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> They have sought me that before asked not for me, they have found me that sought me not. I said: Behold me, behold me, to a nation that did not call upon my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have spread forth my hands all the day to an unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not good after their own thoughts.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A people that continually provoke me to anger before my face: that immolate in gardens, and sacrifice upon bricks.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That dwell in sepulchres, and sleep in the temple of idols: that eat swine's flesh, and profane broth is in their vessels.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That say: Depart from me, come not near me, because thou art unclean: these shall be smoke in my anger, a fire burning all the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold it is written before me: I will not be silent, but I will render and repay into their bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord, who have sacrificed upon the mountains, and have reproached me upon the hills; and I will measure back their first work in their bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thus saith the Lord: As if a grain be found in a cluster, and it be said: Destroy it not, because it is a blessing: so will I do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Juda a possessor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the plains shall be turned to folds of hocks, and the valley of Achor into a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And you, that have forsaken the Lord, that have forgotten my holy mount, that set a table for fortune, and offer libations upon it,</p>
            <p data-verse="65:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke, and you did not hear: and you did evil in my eyes, and you have chosen the things that displease me.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold my servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink, and you shall be thirsty.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold my servants shall rejoice, and you shall be confounded: behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And you shall leave your name for an execration to my elect: and the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In which he that is blessed upon the earth, shall be blessed in God, amen: and he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by God, amen: because the former distresses are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shell not come upon the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these things, which I create: for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, end the people thereof joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> There shall no more be an infant of days there, nor an old man that shall not fill up his days: for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree, so shall be the days of my people, and the works of their hands shall be of long continuance.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> My elect shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their posterity with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will hear; as they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; the lion and the ox shall eat straw; and dust shall be the serpent's food: they shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="65:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</p>
            <p data-verse="65:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</p>
            <p data-verse="65:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</p>

            <p data-verse="65:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p>

            <p data-verse="65:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="65:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</p>
            <p data-verse="65:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="65:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>
