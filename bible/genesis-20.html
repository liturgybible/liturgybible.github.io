            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between Cedes and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Oerara sent, and took her.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman thou hast taken: for she hath a husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said : Lord, wilt thou slay a nation, that is ignorant and justl</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Did not he say to me : She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thins.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And again he expostulated with him, and said, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after God brought me out of my father's house, I said to her: I Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara, his wife.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech on ac- count of Sara, Abraham's wife.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.</p>
