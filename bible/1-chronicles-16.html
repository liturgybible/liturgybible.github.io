            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when David had made an end of offering holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he divided to all and every one, both men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify, and praise the Lord God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to the Lord with his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make known his doings among the nations.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Remember his wonderful works, which he hath done: his signs, and the judgments of his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> O ye seed of Israel his servants, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The covenant which he made with Abraham: and his oath to Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he appointed the same to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised: and he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and joy in his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations: bring ye to the Lord glory and empire.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy becomingness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Let all the earth be moved at his presence : for he hath founded the world immoveable.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour: and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence of the ark continually day by day, and in their courses.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Obededom, with his brethren sixty-eight: and Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to be porters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gabaon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> That they should offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest that were chosen, every one by his name to give praise to the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpet, and played on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless also his own house.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>
