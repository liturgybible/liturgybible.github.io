            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When Adonisedec king of Jerusalem had heard these things, to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai, and its king,) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most valiant.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore Adonisedec king of Jerusalem sent to Oham king of Hebron, and to Pharam king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia king of Lachis, and to Dabir king of Eglon, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon which was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him, most valiant men.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord troubled them at the sight of Israel: and he slew them with a great slaughter in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to Beth-horon, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were in the descent of Beth-horon, the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with the hailstones than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> There was not before nor after so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Josue returned with all Israel into the camp of Galgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For the five kings were fled, and had hidden themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it was told Josue that the five kings were found hidden in a cave of the city of Maceda.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men, to keep them shut up:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands to shelter themselves in their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered into fenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all the army returned to Josue in Maceda, where the camp then was, in good health and without the loss of any one: and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when they were Drought out to him, he called all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him: Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets, and they hung until the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast them into the cave where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The same day Josue took Maceda and destroyed it, with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and investing it with his army, besieged it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> At that time Horam king of Gazer, came up to succour Lachis: and Josue slew him with all his people, so as to leave none alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Returning from thence to Dabir,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> He took it and destroyed it: the king also thereof and all the towns round about he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna and to their kings, so did he to Dabir and to the king thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So Josue conquered all the country of the hills and of the south and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded him,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen even to Gabaon,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted at one onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</p>
