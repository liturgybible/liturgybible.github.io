            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to the provoking, and redeemed city, the dove.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she received discipline: she hath not trusted in the Lord, she drew not near to her God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions: her judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Her prophets are senseless men without faith: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not known shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I have destroyed the nations, and their towers are beaten down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man remaining, nor any inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction: and her dwelling shall not perish, for all things wherein I have visited her: but they rose early and corrupted all their thoughts.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy shall all the earth be devoured.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with one shoulder.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants the children of my dispersed people bring me an offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no more be lifted up because of my holy mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to make them afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned away thy enemies: the king of Israel the Lord is in the midst of thee, thou shalt fear evil no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to Sion: Let not thy hands be weakened.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The triflers that were departed from the law, I will gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no more suffer reproach for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at that time: and I will save her that halteth, and will gather her that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all the land where they had been put to confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</p>
