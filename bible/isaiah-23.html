            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Be silent, you that dwell in the island: the merchants of Sidon passing over the sea, have filled thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The seed of the Nile in many waters, the harvest of the river is her revenue: and she is become the mart of the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Be thou ashamed, O Sidon: for the sea speaketh, even the strength of the sea, saying: I have not been in labour, nor have I brought forth, nor have I nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When it shall be heard in Egypt, they will be sorry when they shall hear of Tyre:</p>

            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Is not this your city, which gloried from of old in her antiquity? her feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, that was formerly crowned, whose merchants were princes, and her traders the nobles of the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord of hosts hath designed it, to pull down the pride of all glory, and bring to disgrace all the glorious ones of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Pass thy land as a river, O daughter of the sea, thou hast a girdle no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He stretched out his hand over the sea, he troubled kingdoms: the Lord hath given a charge against Chanaan, to destroy the strong ones thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said: Thou shalt glory no more, O virgin daughter of Sidon, who art oppressed: arise and sail over to Cethim, there also thou shalt have no, rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Behold the land of the Chaldeans, there was not such a people, the Assyrian founded it: they have led away the strong ones thereof into captivity, they have destroyed the houses thereof, they have brought it to ruin.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it shall come to pass in that day that thou, O Tyre, shalt be forgotten, seventy years, according to the days of one king: but after seventy years, there shall be unto Tyre as the song of a harlot.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten: sing well, sing many a song, that thou mayst be remembered.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it shall come to pass after seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, and will bring her back again to her traffic: and she shall commit fornication again with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And her merchandise and her hire shall be sanctified to the Lord: they shall not be kept in store, nor laid up: for her merchandise shall be for them that shall dwell before the Lord, that they may eat unto fulness, and be clothed for a continuance.</p>
