            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After Abimelech there arose a ruler in Israel, Thola son of Phua the uncle of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, who dwelt in Samir of mount Ephraim:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he judged Israel three and twenty years, and he died and was buried in Samir.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To him succeeded Jair the Galaadite, who judged Israel for two and twenty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Having thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and were princes of thirty cities, which from his name were called Havoth Jair, that is, the towns of Jair, until this present day in the land of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jair died: and was buried in the place which was called Camon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But the children of Israel, adding new sins to their old ones, did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served idols, Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria and of Sidon and of Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philistines: and they left the Lord, and did not serve him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord being angry with them, delivered them into the hands of the Philistines and of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they were afflicted, and grievously oppressed for eighteen years, all they that dwelt beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorrhite, who is in Galaad:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Insomuch that the children of Ammon passing over the Jordan, wasted Juda and Benjamin and Ephraim: and Israel was distressed exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they cried to the Lord, and said: We have sinned against thee, because we have forsaken the Lord our God, and have served Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord said to them: Did not the Egyptians and the Amorrhites, and the children of Ammon and the Philistines,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Sidonians also and Amalec and Chanaan oppress you, and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And yet you have forsaken me, and have worshipped strange gods: therefore I will deliver you no more:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Go and call upon the gods which you have chosen: let them deliver you in the time of distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the children of Israel said to the Lord: We have sinned, do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee: only deliver us this time.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And saying these things, they cast away out of their coasts all the idols of strange gods and served the Lord their God: and he was touched with their miseries.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the children of Ammon shouting together, pitched their tents in Galaad: against whom the children of Israel assembled themselves together and camped in Maspha.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the princes of Galaad said one to another: Whosoever of us shall first begin to fight against the children of Ammon, he shall be the leader of the people of Galaad.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</p>
