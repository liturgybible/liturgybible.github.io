            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He went also into Gaza, and saw there a woman a harlot, and went in unto her.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when the Philistines had beard this, and it was noised about among them, that Samson was come into the city, they surrounded him, setting guards at the gate of the city, and watching there all the night in silence, that in the morning they might kill him as he went out.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Samson slept till midnight, and then rising he took both the doors of the gate, with the posts thereof, and the bolt, and laying them on his shoulders, carried them up to the top of the hill, which looketh towards Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was called Dalila.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and said: Deceive him, and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Dalila said to Samson: Tell me, I beseech thee, wherein thy greatest strength lieth, and what it is wherewith if thou wert bound thou couldst not break loose.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords, such is he spoke of, with which she bound him;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the chamber expecting the event of the thing, and she cried out to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the bands, as a man would break a thread of tow twined with spittle, when it smelleth the fire: so it was not known wherein his strength Jay.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast told me a false thing: but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he answered her: If I shall be bound with new ropes, that were never in work, I shall be weak and like other men.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Dalila bound him again with these, and cried out: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson, there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber. But he broke the bands like threads of webs.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Dalila said to him again: How long dost thou deceive me, and tell me lies? Shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound. And Samson answered her: If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with a lace, and tying them round about a nail fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking out of his sleep he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Dalila said to him: How dost thou say thou lovest me, when thy mind is not with me? Thou hast told me lies these three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy great strength lieth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when she pressed him much, and continually hung upon him for many days, giving him no time to rest, his soul fainted away, and was wearied even until death.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her: The razor hath never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite, that is to say, consecrated to God from my mother's womb: if my head be shaven, my strength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be like other men.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then seeing that be had discovered to her all his mind, she sent to the princes of the Philistines, saying: Come up this once more, for now he hath opened his heart to me. And they went up taking with them the money which they had promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom. And she called a barber, and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from her: for immediately his strength departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking from sleep, he said in his mind: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in prison made him grind.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And now his hair began to grow again.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the princes of the Philistines assembled together, to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the same: Our god hath delivered our adversary into our bands, him that destroyed our country and killed very many.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their good cheer, they commanded that Samson should be called, and should play before them. And being brought out of prison he played before them, and they made him stand between two pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the pillars which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now the house was full of men and women, and all the princes of the Philistines were there. Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes from the roof and the higher part of the house, were beholding Samson's play.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But he called upon the Lord, saying: O Lord God, remember me, and restore to me now my former strength, O my God, that I may revenge myself on my enemies, and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested, and holding the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he had strongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude that was there: and he killed many more at his death, than he had killed before in his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol in the buryingplace of his father Manue: and he judged Israel twenty years.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.</p>
