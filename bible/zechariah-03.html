            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan: and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments: and he stood before the face of the angel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who answered, and said to them that stood before him, saying: Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said to him: Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with change of garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said: Put a clean mitre upon his head: and they put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of the Lord stood.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and Beep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to walk with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, then and thy friends that dwell before thee, for they are portending men: for behold I WILL BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus: upon one stone there are seven eyes: behold I will grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shell call his friend under the vine and under the fig tree.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p>

And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</p>
