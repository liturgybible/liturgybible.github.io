            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and in mercy ordering all things,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we will not sin, knowing that we are counted thine.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thy power is the root of immortality.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter’s fruitless labour;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay, even he which a little before was made of earth himself, and within a little while after returneth to the same, out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here a market for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they are slow to go.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands: for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth: whereas he lived once, but they never.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful: for being compared together, some are worse than others.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God and his blessing.</p>
