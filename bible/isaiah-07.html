            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail over it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Lord said to Isaias: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, a in the way of the fuller's held.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these fire brands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria, end of the son of Romelia.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, and this shall not be.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Basin: and within threescore and five years, Ephraim shall cease to be a people:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not continue.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For before the child know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall become thorns and briers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither: for briars and thorns shall be in all the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And as for all the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.</p>
