            <p data-verse="51:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Look unto Abraham your father, and to Sara that bore you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and multiplied him.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord therefore will comfort Sion, and will comfort all the ruins thereof: and he will make her desert as a place of pleasure, and her wilderness as the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hearken unto me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my tribes: for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment shall rest to be a light of the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My just one is near at hand, my saviour is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people: the islands shall look for me, and shall patiently wait for my arm.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Lift up your eyes to heaven, and look down to the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth shall be worn away like a garment, and the inhabitants thereof shall perish in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my justice shall not fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Hearken to me, you that know what is just, my people who have my law in your heart: fear ye not the reproach of men, and be not afraid of their blasphemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the worm shall eat them up as a garment: and the moth shall consume them as wool: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my justice from generation to generation,</p>
            <p data-verse="51:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Arise, arise, put on strength, O thou arm of the Lord, arise as in the days of old, in the ancient generations. Hast not thou struck the proud one, and wounded the dragon?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Hast not thou dried up the sea, the water of the mighty deep, who madest the depth of the sea a way, that the delivered might pass over?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now they that are redeemed by the Lord, shall return, and shall come into Sion singing praises, and joy everlasting shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou hast forgotten the Lord thy maker, who stretched out the heavens, and founded the earth: and thee hast been afraid continually all the day at the presence of his fury who afflicted thee, and had prepared himself to destroy thee: where is now the fury of the oppressor?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He shall quickly come that is going to open unto you, and he shall not kill unto utter destruction, neither shall his bread fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I am the Lord thy God, who trouble the sea, and the waves thereof swell: the Lord of hosts is my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have put my words in thy mouth, and have protected thee in the shadow of my hand, that thou mightest plant the heavens, and found the earth: and mightest say to Sion: Thou art my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunk even to the bottom of the cup of dead sleep, and thou hast drunk even to the dregs.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is none that can uphold her among all the children that she hath brought forth: and there is none that taketh her by the hand among all the children that she hath brought up.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There are two things that have happened to thee: who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword, who shall comfort thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thy children are cast forth, they have slept at the head of all the ways, as the wild ox that is snared: full of the indignation of the Lord, of the rebuke of thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore hear this, thou poor little one, and thou that art drunk but no with wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith thy Sovereign the Lord and thy God, who will fight for his people: Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of dead sleep, the dregs of the cup of my indignation, thou shalt not drink it again any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I will put it in the hand of them that have oppressed thee, and have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as a way to them that went over.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;</p>
            <p data-verse="51:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</p>
            <p data-verse="51:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="51:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.</p>

            <p data-verse="51:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</p>
            <p data-verse="51:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</p>
