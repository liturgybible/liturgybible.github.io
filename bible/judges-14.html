            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Samson went down to Thamnatlia, and seeing there a woman of the daughters of the Philistines,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He came up, and told his father and his mother, saying: I saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines: I beseech you, take her for me to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his father and mother said to him: Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou wilt take a wife of the Philistines, who are uncircumcised? And Samson said to his father: Take this woman for me, for she hath pleased my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord, and that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young lion met him raging and roaring.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he tore the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces, having nothing at all in his hand: and he would not tell this to his father and mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he went down and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And after some days returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion and a honeycomb.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when be had taken it in his hands, he went on eating: and coming to his father and mother, he gave them of it, and they ate: but he would not tell them, that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So his father went down to the woman, and made a feast for his son Samson: for so the young men used to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the citizens of that place saw him, they brought him thirty companions to be with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many coats:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty shirts and the same number of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle that we may hear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of Samson: Soothe thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy father's house. Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So she wept before Samson and complained, saying: Thou hatest me, and dost not love me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people. But he answered: I would not tell it to my father and mother, and how can I tell it to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and at length on the seventh day as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately told her countrymen.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they on the seventh day before the sun went down said to him: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon, and slew there thirty men, whose garments he took away and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And being exceeding angry he went up to his father's house:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But his wife took one of his friends and bridal companions for her husband.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</p>
