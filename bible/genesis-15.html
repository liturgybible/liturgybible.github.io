            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy reward exceeding great.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant, born in my house, shall be my heir.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he thought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy seed be.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to gibe thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old, and a she goat of three years, and a ram of three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one against the other; but the birds he divided not.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the fowls came down upon carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Cineans and Cenezites, the Cedmonites,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim also,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanits, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>
