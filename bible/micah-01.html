            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem ?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people even to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ya not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth : the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee.</p>
