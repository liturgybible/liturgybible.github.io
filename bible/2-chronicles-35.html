            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Josias kept a phase to the Lord in Jerusalem, and it was sacrificed on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he set the priests in their offices, and exhorted them to minister in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he spoke to the Levites, by whose instruction all Israel was sanctified to the Lord, saying: Put the ark in the sanctuary of the temple, which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built : for you shall carry it no more: but minister now to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And prepare yourselves by your houses, and families according to your courses, as David king of Israel commanded, and Solomon his son hath written.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And serve ye in the sanctuary by the families and companies of Levi.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And being sanctified kill the phase, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Josias gave to all the people that were found there in the solemnity of the phase, of lambs and of kids of the flocks, and of other small cattle thirty thousand, and of oxen three thousand, all these were of the king's substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And his princes willingly offered what they had vowed, both to the people and to the priests and the Levites. Moreover Helcias, and Zacharias, and Jahiel rulers of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests to keep the phase two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Chonenias, and Semeias and Nathanael, his brethren, and Hasabias, and Jehiel, and Jozabad princes of the Levites, gave to the rest of the Levites to celebrate the phase five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the ministry was prepared, and the priests stood in their office: the Levites also in their companies, according to the king's commandment.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the phase was immolated: and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the Levites flayed the holocausts:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they separated them to give them by the houses and families of every one, and to be offered to the Lord, as it is written in the book of Moses, and with the oxen they did in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they roasted the phase with fire, according to that which is written in the law: but the victims of peace offerings they boiled in caldrons, and kettles, and pots, and they distributed them speedily among all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: for the priests were busied in offering of holocausts and the fat until night: wherefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron last.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the singers the sons of Asaph stood in their order, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Idithun the prophets of the king: and the porters kept guard at every gate, so as not to depart one moment from their service: and therefore their brethren the Levites prepared meats for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So all the service of the Lord was duly accomplished that day, both in keeping the phase, and offering holocausts upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king Josias.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the children of Israel that were found there, kept the phase at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There was no phase like to this in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet: neither did any of all the kings of Israel keep such a phase as Josias kept, with the priests, and the Levites, and all Juda, and Israel that were found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this phase celebrated.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> After that Josias had repaired the temple, Nechao king of Egypt came up to fight in Charcamis by the Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But he sent messengers to him, saying: What have I to do with thee, O king of Juda? I come not against thee this day, but I fight against another house, to which God hath commanded me to go in haste : forbear to do against God, who is with me, lest he kill thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Josias would not return, but prepared to fight against him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao from the mouth of God, I but went to fight in the field of Mageddo.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there he was wounded by the archers, and he said to his servants: Carry me out of the battle, for I am grievously wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they removed him from the chariot into another, that followed him after the manner of kings, and they carried him away to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the monument of his fathers, and all Juda and Jerusalem mourned for him,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Particularly Jeremias: whose lamentations for Josias all the singing men and singing women repeat unto this day, and it became like a law in Israel: Behold it is found written in the Lamentations.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josias and of his mercies, according to what was commanded by the law of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And his works first and last, are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>
