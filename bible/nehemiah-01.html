            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said: WI beseech thee, 0 Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments :</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's house have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And these are thy servants, and thy people : whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</p>

            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.</p>
