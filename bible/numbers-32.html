            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many flocks of cattle, and their substance in beasts was infinite. And when they saw the lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> They came to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and the princes of the multitude, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nemra, Hesebon, and Eleale, and Saban, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The land, which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of the children of Israel, is a very fertile soil for the feeding of beasts: and we thy servants have very much cattle:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And we pray thee, if we have found favour in thy sight, that thou give it to us thy servants in possession, and make us not pass over the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses answered them: What, shall your brethren go to fight, and will you sit here?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Why do ye overturn the minds of the children of Israel, that they may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath given them?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Was it not thus your fathers did, when I sent from Cadesbarne to view the land?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they were come as far as the valley of the cluster, having viewed all the country, they overturned the hearts of the children of Israel, that they should not enter into the coasts, which the Lord gave them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he swore in his anger, saying:.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If these men, that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land, which I promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: because they would not follow me,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, and Josue the son of Nun: these have fulfilled my will.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord being angry against Israel, led them about through the desert forty years, until the whole generation, that had done evil in his sight, was consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And behold, said he, you are risen up instead of your fathers, the increase and offspring of sinful men, to augment the fury of the Lord against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if you will not follow him, he will leave the people in the wilderness, end you shall be the cause of the destruction of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But they coming near, said: We will make sheepfolds, and stalls for our cattle, and strong cities for our children :</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle before the children of Israel, until we bring them in unto their places. Our little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled cities, for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> We will not return into our houses until the children of Israel possess their inheritance:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan, because we have already our possession on the east side thereof,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses said to them: If you do what you promise, go on well appointed for war before the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan, until the Lord overthrow his enemies :</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And all the land be brought under him, then shall you be blameless before the Lord and before Israel, and you shall obtain the countries that you desire, before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But if you do not what you say, no man can doubt but you sin against God: and know ye, that your sin shall overtake you.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Build therefore cities for your children, and folds and stalls for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish what you have promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the children of Gad and Ruben said to Moses: We are thy servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> We will leave our children, and our wives and sheep and cattle, in the cities of Galaad:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to the war, as thou, my lord, speakest.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families of all the tribes of Israel, and said to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> If the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben pass with you over the Jordan, all armed for war before the Lord, and the land be made subject to you: give them Galaad in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of Chanaan, let them receive places to dwell in among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben answered: As the Lord hath spoken to his servants, so will we do:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> We will go armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan, and we confess that we have already received our possession beyond the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Moses therefore gave to the children of Cad and of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and their land and the cities thereof round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the sons of Cad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Etroth, and Sophan, and Jazer, and Jegbaa,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Bethnemra, and Betharan, fenced cities, and folds for their cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But the children of Ruben built Hesebon, and Eleale, and Cariathaim,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Nabo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Sabama: giving names to the cities which they had built.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Moreover the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, went into Galaad, and wasted it, cutting off the Amorrhites, the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of Manasses, and he dwelt in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Jair the son of Manasses went, and took the villages thereof, and he called them Havoth Jair, that is to say, the villages of Jair.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Nobe also went, and took Canath with the villages thereof: and he called it by his own name, Nobe.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD’S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</p>
