            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And say: Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions, and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the nations heard of him, and took him, but not without receiving wounds: and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But she seeing herself weakened, and that her hope was lost, took one of her young lions, and set him up for a lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He learned to make widows, and to lay waste their cities: and the land became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the nations Game together against him on every side out of the provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he was taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon: and they cast him into prison, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water: her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches: and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But she was plucked up in wrath, and cast on the ground, and the burning wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods are withered, and dried up: the fire hath devoured her.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And now she is transplanted into the desert, in a land not passable, and dry.</p>
