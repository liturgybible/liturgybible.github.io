            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the locust was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king's mowing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee: who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a part at the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little one?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason's trowel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A mason's trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the house of the idol.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king’s chapel, and it is the king’s court.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p>
