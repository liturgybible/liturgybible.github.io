            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And Peter going out, wept bitterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>
