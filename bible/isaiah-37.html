            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he sent Eliacim who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaias the son of Amos the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and to reproach with words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the servants of Ezechias came to Isaias.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return to his own country, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Rabsaces returned, end found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna. W For he had heard that he was departed from Lachis.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he heard say about Tharaca the king of Ethiopia: He is come forth to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus shall you speak to Ezechias the king of Juda, saying: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians hare done to all countries which they have destroyed, and canst thou be delivered?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozam, and Haram, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thalassar?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Ezechias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and Ezechias spread it before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Ezechias prayed to the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Incline, O Lord, thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste lands, and their countries.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the works of men's hands, of wood and stone: and they broke them in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand: and let all the kingdoms of the earth know, that thou only art the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: For the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> This is the word which the Lord hath spoken of him: The virgin the daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord: and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus: and I will out down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees, end will enter to the top of its height, to the forest of its Carmel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I have digged, and drunk water, and have dried up with the sole of my foot, all the rivers shut up in banks.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Hast thou not heard what I have done to him of old? from the days of old I have formed it: and now I have brought it to effect: and it hath come to pass that hills fighting together, and fenced cities should be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled, and were confounded: they became like the grass of the field, and the herb of the pasture, and like the grass of the housetops, which withered before it was ripe.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When thou wast mad against me, thy pride came up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But to thee this shall be a sign: Eat this year the things that spring of themselves, and in the second year eat fruits: but in the third year sow and reap, and giant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda, and which is left, shall take root downward, and shall bear fruit upward :</p>
            <p data-verse="37:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a, remnant, and salvation from mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> By the way that he came, he shall return, and into this city he shall not come, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the angel of the Lord went out, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold they were all dead corpses.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians went out and departed, and returned, and dwelt in Ninive.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword: and they fled into the land of Ararat, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
