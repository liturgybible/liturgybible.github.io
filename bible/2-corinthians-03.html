            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
