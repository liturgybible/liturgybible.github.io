            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews that dwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in Memphis, and in the land of Phatures, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You have seen all this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Juda: and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabitant in them:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to provoke me to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers knew.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early, and sending, and saying: Do not commit this abominable thing, which I hate.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their evil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against your own souls, that there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling out of the midst of Juda, and no remnant should be left you:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which you are come to dwell there: and that you should perish, and be a curse, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They are not cleansed even to this day: neither have they feared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments, which I set before you and your fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will set my face upon you for evil: and I will destroy all Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there: and they shall be all consumed in the land of Egypt: they shall fall by the sword, and by the famine: and they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they die: and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for a curse, and for a reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of the remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of Egypt: and that shall return into the land of Juda, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: there shall none return but they that shall flee.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to other gods: and all the women of whom there stood by a great multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our princes in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink offerings to her: did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink offerings to her, without our husbands?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and Sour fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the Lord hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the Lord: and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Jeremias said to all the people, and to all the women : Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying: You and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with your hands, saying: Let us perform our vows which we have made, to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her: you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed them indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord: that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying: The Lord God liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be consumed, by the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda: and all the remnant of Juda that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or theirs.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I will punish you in this place: that you may know that my words shall be accomplished indeed against you for evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver Pharao Ephree king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life: as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy, and that sought his life.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.</p>
