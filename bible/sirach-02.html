            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Cleave unto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whatsoever is brought upon thee take cheerfully, and be patient when thou art changed to a low estate.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Believe in him, and he will help thee; order thy way aright, and trust in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; and go not aside, lest ye fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Ye that fear the Lord, believe him; and your reward shall not fail.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good, and for everlasting joy and mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Look at the generations of old, and see; did ever any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his fear, and was forsaken? or whom did he ever despise, that called upon him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in time of affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Woe be to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two ways!</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Woe unto him that is fainthearted! for he believeth not; therefore shall he not be defended.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Woe unto you that have lost patience! and what will ye do when the Lord shall visit you?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They that fear the Lord will not disobey his Word; and they that love him will keep his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They that fear the Lord will seek that which is well, pleasing unto him; and they that love him shall be filled with the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They that fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, and humble their souls in his sight,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Saying, We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his majesty is, so is his mercy.</p>
