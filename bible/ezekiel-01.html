            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Bud in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they bad faces, and wings on the four sides,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Whithersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>
