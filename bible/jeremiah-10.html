            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear ye the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord: Learn not according to the ways of the Gentiles: and be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the laws of the people are vain: for the works of the hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an axe.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall asunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they cannot go. Therefore, fear them not, for they can neither do evil nor good.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great and great is thy name in might.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who shall fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They shall all proved together to be senseless and foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things are the work of artificers.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and the everlasting king, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from among those places that are under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth for the wind out of his treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and there is no spirit in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They are vain things and a ridiculous work: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the Lord of hosts is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest in a siege.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them, so that they may be found.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous. But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their flock is scattered.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and a dwelling for dragons.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</p>
