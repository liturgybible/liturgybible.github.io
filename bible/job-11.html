            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do ? he is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he knoweth the vanity of men, and when he seeth iniquity, doth he not consider it?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass's colt.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Rut thou hast hardened thy heart, and hast spread thy hands to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and lot not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thou shalt also forget misery, and remember it only as waters that are passed away.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And brightness like that of the noonday, shall arise to thee at evening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day star.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee, and being buried thou shalt sleep secure.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall entreat thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</p>
