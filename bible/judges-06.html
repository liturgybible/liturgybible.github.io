            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hand of Madian seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they were grievously oppressed by them. And they made themselves dens and eaves in the mountains, and strong holds to resist.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when Israel had sown, Madian and Amalec, and the rest of the eastern nations came up:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And pitching their tents among them, wasted all things as they were in the blade even to the entrance of Gaza: and they left nothing at all in Israel for sustenance of life, nor sheep, nor oxen, nor asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For they and all their flocks came with their tents, and like locusts filled all places, an innumerable multitude of men, and of camels, wasting whatsoever they touched.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of Madian.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he cried to the Lord desiring help against the Madianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he sent unto them a prophet, and he spoke: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I made you to come up out of Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians, and of all the enemies that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your coming in, and gave you their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And an angel of the Lord came, and sat under an oak, that was in Ephra, and belonged to Joas the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon his son was threshing and cleansing wheat by the winepress, to flee from Madian,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The Lord is with thee, O most valiant of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if the Lord be with us, why have these evils fallen upon us? Where are his miracles, which our fathers have told us of, saying: The Lord brought us Out of Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the bands of Madian.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord looked upon him, and said: Go in this thy strength, and then shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian: know that I have sent thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He answered and said: I beseech thee, my lord, wherewith shall I deliver Israel? Behold my family is the meanest in Manasses, and I am the least in my father's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut off Madian as one man.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and bring a sacrifice, and offer it to thee. And he answered: I will wait thy coming.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh and the unleavened loaves, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done so,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and the angel of the Lord vanished out of his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord, said: Alas, my Lord God: for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it the Lord's peace, until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the family of Ezri,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> That night the Lord said to him: Take a bullock of thy father's, and another bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is thy father's: and cut down the grove that is about the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God in the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer a holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Gedeon taking ten men of his servants, did as the Lord had commanded him. But fearing his father's house, and the men of that city, he would not do it by day, but did all by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when the men of that town were risen in the morning, they saw the altar of Baal destroyed, and the grove cut down, and the second bullock laid upon the altar, which then was built.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they inquired for the author of the fact, it was said: Gedeon the son of Joas did all this.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that he may die: because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut down his grove.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He answered them: Are you the avengers of Baal, that you fight for him? he that is his adversary, let him die before to morrow light appear: if he be a god, let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joss had said: Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Now all Madian, and Amalec, and the eastern people were gathered together, and passing over the Jordan, camped in the valley of Jezrael.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and be sounded the trumpet and called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he sent messengers into all Manasses, and they also followed him: and other messengers into Aser and Zabulon and Nephtali, and they came to meet him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground beside, I, shall know that by my hand, as thou hast said, thou wilt deliver Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And it was so. And rising before day wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he said again to God: let not thy wrath be kindled against me if I try once more, seeking a sign in the fleece. I pray that the fleece only may be dry, and all the ground wet with dew.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And God did that night as he had requested: and it was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</p>
