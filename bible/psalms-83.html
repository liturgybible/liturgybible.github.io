            <p data-verse="83:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O God, who shall be like to thee? hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For lo, thy enemies have made a noise: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They have said: Come and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation: and let the name of Israel be remembered no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For they have contrived with one consent: they have made a covenant together against thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="83:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> the tabernacles of the Edomites, and the Ismahelites: Moab, and the Agarens,</p>
            <p data-verse="83:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Gebal, and Ammon and Amalec: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Yea, and the Assyrian also is joined with them: they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Do to them as thou didst to Madian and to Sisara: as to Jabin at the brook of Cisson.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who perished at Endor: and became as dung for the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Make their princes like Oreb, and Zeb, and Zebee, and Salmana. All their princes,</p>
            <p data-verse="83:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> who have said: Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> O my God, make them like a wheel; and as stubble before the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As fire which burneth the wood: and as a flame burning mountains:</p>
            <p data-verse="83:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest: and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.</p>

            <p data-verse="83:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
            <p data-verse="83:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="83:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>
            <p data-verse="83:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="83:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
            <p data-verse="83:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That men may know that thou, whose name alone is  JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</p>
