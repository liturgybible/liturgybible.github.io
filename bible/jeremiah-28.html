            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in that year, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananias the son of Azur, a prophet of Gabaon spoke to me, in the house of the Lord before the priests, and all the people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As yet two years of days, and I will cause all the vessels of the house of the Lord to be brought back into this place, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will bring back to this place Jechonias the son of Joakim king of Juda, and all the captives of Juda, that are gone to Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jeremias the prophet said: Amen, the Lord do so: the Lord perform thy words, which thou hast prophesied: that the vessels may be brought again into the house of the Lord, and all the captives may return out of Babylon to this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Nevertheless hear this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The prophets that have been before me, and before thee from the beginning, and have prophesied concerning many countries, and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of affliction, and of famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The prophet that prophesied peace when his word shall come to pass, the prophet shall be known, whom the Lord hath sent in truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Hananias the prophet took the chain from the neck of Jeremias the prophet, and broke it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Hananias spoke in the presence of all the people, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon after two full years from off the neck of all the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jeremias the prophet went his way. And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Hananias the prophet had broken the chain from off the neck of Jeremias the prophet, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Go, and tell Hananias: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast broken chains of wood, and thou shalt make for them chains of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, to serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and they shall serve him: moreover also I have given him the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet: Hear now, Hananias: the Lord hath not sent thee, and thou hast made this people to trust in a lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die: for thou hast spoken against the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Hananias the prophet died in that year, in the seventh month.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.</p>
