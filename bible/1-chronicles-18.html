            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites were made David's servants, and brought him gifts.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> At that time David defeated also Adarezer king of Soba of the land of Hemath, when he went to extend his dominions as far as the river Euphrates.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and he houghed all the chariot horses, only a hundred chariots, which he reserved for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Syrians of Damascus came also to help Adarezer king of Soba: and David slew of them likewise two and twenty thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all things to which he went.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David took the golden quivers which the servants of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer, he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He sent Adoram his son to king David, to desire peace of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to Adarezer.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And all the vessels of gold, and silver, and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines, and from Amalec.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:</p>

            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</p>
