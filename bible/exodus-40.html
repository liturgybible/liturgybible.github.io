            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the veil before it:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite. The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt, before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And before it the altar of holocaust:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> If it hung over, they remained in the same place.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>
