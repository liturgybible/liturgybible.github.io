            <p data-verse="52:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jerernias of Lobna.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and against Juda, till he cast t hem out from his presence: and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedecias.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city: and there was no food for the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about, ) sad they went by the way that leadeth to the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king: and they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho: and all his companions were scattered from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes: and he slew all the princes of Juda in Reblatha.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and he put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan the general of the army, who stood before the king of Babylon in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the general broke down all the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort who remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan the general left some for vinedressers, and for husbandmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass that was in the house of the Lord: and they carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they took the caldrons, and the fleshhooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry: and</p>
            <p data-verse="52:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars, and the cups: as many as were of gold, in gold: and as many as were of silver, in silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="52:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about: but the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And chapiters of brass were upon both: and the height of one chapiter was five cubits: and network, and pomegranates were upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down: and the pomegranates being a hundred in all, were compassed with network.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and Sophonias the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief over the men of war: and seven men of them that were near the king's person, that were found in the city: and a scribe, an officer of the army who exercised the young soldiers: and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Nabuzardan the general took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried away captive out of his land.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive : in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuzardan the general carried away of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Joachin king of Juda, and brought him forth out of prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread before him always all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</p>

            <p data-verse="52:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="52:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="52:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
            <p data-verse="52:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</p>
            <p data-verse="52:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</p>
            <p data-verse="52:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</p>
            <p data-verse="52:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</p>
            <p data-verse="52:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="52:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</p>
