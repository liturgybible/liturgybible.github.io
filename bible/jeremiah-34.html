            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, (when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth, that were under the power of his hand, and all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof,) saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Sedecias king of Juda, and say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand: but thou shalt surely be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand: and thy eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Sedecias king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But thou shalt die in peace, and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they burn thee: and they shall mourn for thee, saying: Alas, Lord: for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jeremias the prophet spoke all these words to Sedecias the king of Juda in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda that were left, against Lachis, and against Azecha: for these remained of the cities of Juda, fenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that king Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem making a proclamation:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free: and that they should not lord it over them, to wit, over the Jews their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the princes, and all the people who entered into the covenant, heard that every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant go free, and should no more have dominion over them: and they obeyed, and let them go free.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But afterwards they turned: and brought back again their servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and brought them into subjection as menservants and maidservants.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> At the end of seven years, let ye go every man his brother being a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee: and your fathers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And you turned to day, and did that which was right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother: and you made a covenant in my sight, in the house upon which my name is invocated.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And you are fallen back, and have defiled my name: and you have brought back again every man his manservant, and every man his maidservant, whom you had let go free, and set at liberty: and you have brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: You have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty every man to his brother and every man to his friend: behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine: and I will cause you to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, and have not performed the words of the covenant which they agreed to in my presence, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The princes of Juda, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land that passed between the parts of the calf:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, I will give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the king of Babylon, which are gone from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold I will command, saith the Lord, and I will bring them again to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Juda a desolation, without an inhabitant.</p>

            <p data-verse="34:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</p>
            <p data-verse="34:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,</p>
            <p data-verse="34:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;</p>
            <p data-verse="34:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="34:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.</p>
