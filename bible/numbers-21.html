            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: It thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And speaking against God end Moses, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Upon which they came to Moses, and said: We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray that he may take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to him: Make brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in Oboth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord: As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the Moabites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They sung thereto:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their staves. And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the top of Phasga, which looked towards the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king's highway, till we be past thy borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa, and fought against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, who fought against the king of Moab: and took all the land, that had been of his dominions, as far as the Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer: and they took the villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in Edrai.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his land.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king’s high way, until we be past thy borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p>
