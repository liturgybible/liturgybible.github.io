            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when a long time was passed, after that the Lord had given peace to Israel, all the nations round about being subdued, and Josue being now old, and far advanced in years:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Josue called for all Israel, and for the elders, and for the princes, and for the judges, and for the masters, and said to them: I am old, and far advanced in years:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And you see all that the Lord your God hath done to all the nations round about, how he himself hath fought for you:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And now since he hath divided to you by lot all the land, from the east of the Jordan unto the great sea, and many nations yet remain:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Lord your God will destroy them, and take them away from before your face, and you shall possess the land as he hath promised you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Only take courage, and be careful to observe all things that are written in the book of the law of Moses: and turn not aside from them neither to the right hand nor to the left:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Lest after that you are come in among the Gentiles, who will remain among you, you should swear by the name of their gods, and serve them, and adore them:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But cleave ye unto the Lord your God: as you have done until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great and very strong, and no man shall be able to resist you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies: because the Lord your God himself will fight for you, as he hath promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ,11This only take care of with all diligence, that you love the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you, and make marriages with them, and join friendships:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them be- fore your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way, and a stumblingblock at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you shall know with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform for you, not one hath failed.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he promised, and all things prosperous have come: so Will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off this excellent land, which he hath given you,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When you shall have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which he hath made with you, and shall have served strange gods, and adored them : then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this excellent land, which he hath delivered to you.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the names of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</p>
