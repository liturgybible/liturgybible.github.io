            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David assembled all the chief men of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies, who waited on the king: and the captains over thousands, and over hundreds, and them who had the charge over the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons with the officers of the court, and the men of power, and all the bravest of the army at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king rising up, and standing said: Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had a thought to have built a house, in which the ark of the Lord, and the footstool of our God might rest: and I prepared all things for the building.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father's house: and among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And among my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said to me: Solomon thy son shall build my house, and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be a father to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now then before all the assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep ye, and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God: that you may possess the good land, and may leave it to your children after you for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou my son Solomon, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: "for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under- standeth all the thoughts of minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David gave to Solomon his son a description of the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for the mercy seat,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As also of all the courts, which he had in his thought, and of the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of the Lord, and for the treasures of the consecrated things,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And of the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, for all the works of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels of the service of the temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Gold by weight for every vessel for the ministry. And silver by weight ac- cording to the diversity of the vessels and uses.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He gave also gold for the golden candlesticks, and their lamps, according to the dimensions of every candlestick, and the lamps thereof. In like manner also he gave silver by weight for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps according to the diversity of the dimensions of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He gave also gold for the tables of proposition, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other tables of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censers of fine gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the measure he gave by weight, for every lion. In like manner also for lions of silver he set aside a different weight of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All these things, said he, came to me written by the hand of the Lord that I might understand all the works of the pattern.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man, and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, stand by thee, and are ready, and both the princes, and the people know how to execute all thy commandments.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</p>
