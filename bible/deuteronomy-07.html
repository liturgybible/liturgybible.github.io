            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with them, nor shew mercy to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled, and will quickly destroy thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But thus rather shall you deal with them: Destroy their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Not because you surpass all nations in number, is the Lord joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But because the Lord hath loved you, and hath kept his oath, which he swore to your fathers: and hath brought you out with a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand generations:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to destroy them, without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ,11 Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments, which I command thee this day to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Blessed shalt thou be among all people. No one shall be barren among you of either sex, neither of men nor cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord will take away from thee all sickness: and the grievous infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God will deliver to thee. Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, lest they be thy ruin.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, with which the Lord thy God brought thee out: so will he do to all the people, whom thou fearest.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them, until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and could hide themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight: and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their names from under Heaven: no man shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema, like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</p>
