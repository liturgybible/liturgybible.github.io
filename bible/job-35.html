            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say : I am more just than God?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy justice may help the son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he hath not said : Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged before him, and expect him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>

            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:</p>
