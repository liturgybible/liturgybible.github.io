            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men’s hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the law, are of the Lord: love, and the way of good works, are from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Error and darkness had their beginning together with sinners: and evil shall wax old with them that glory therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Like as a partridge taken and kept in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own.</p>
