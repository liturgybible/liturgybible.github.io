            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Is my debate against man, that I should not have just reason to be troubled?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and of children's children in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Their houses are secure and peaceable, and the rod of God is not upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Their cattle have conceived, and failed not: their cow has calved, and is not deprived of her fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children dance and play.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Who have said to God: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what doth it profit us if we pray to him?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Yet because their good things are not in their hand, may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his wrath?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> God shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children: and when he shall repay, then shall he know.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him: and if the number of his months be diminished by one half?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Shall any one teach God knowledge, who judgeth those that are high?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> One man dieth strong, and hale, rich and happy.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Surely I know your thoughts, and your unjust judgments against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For you say: Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Ask any one of them that go by the way, and you shall perceive that he knoweth these same things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Because the wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the heap of the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he shall draw every man after him, and there are innumerable before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> How then do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shewn to be repugnant to truth ?</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>

            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</p>
