            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> We have heard, O God, with our ears : our fathers have declared to us, The work, thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them : thou didst afflict the people and cast them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword : neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance : because thou wast pleased with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving of Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn : and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For I will not trust in my bow : neither shall my sword save me.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us : and hast put them to shame that hate us.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In God shall we glory all the day long : and in thy name we will give praise for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame : and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies : and they that hated us plundered for themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten : thou hast scattered us among the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou hast sold thy people for no price : and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles : a shaking of the head among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> All the day long my shame is before me : and the confusion of my face hath covered me,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me : at the face of the enemy and persecutor.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee : and we have not done wickedly in they covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And our heart hath not turned back : neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction : and the shadow of death hath covered us.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god :</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Shall not God search out these things : for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long : we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Why turnest thou face away? and forgettest our want and our trouble?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For our soul is humbled down to the dust : our belly cleaveth to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name's sake.</p>
