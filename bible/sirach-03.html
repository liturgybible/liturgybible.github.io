            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear me your father, O children, and do thereafter, that ye may be safe.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the Lord hath given the father honour over the children, and hath confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Whoso honoureth his father maketh an atonement for his sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whoso honoureth his father shall have joy of his own children; and when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that honoureth his father shall have a long life; and he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He that feareth the Lord will honour his father, and will do service unto his parents, as to his masters.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Honour thy father and mother both in word and deed, that a blessing may come upon thee from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children; but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Glory not in the dishonour of thy father; for thy father’s dishonour is no glory unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My son, go on with thy business in meekness; so shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and thou shalt find favour before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Many are in high place, and of renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the power of the Lord is great, and he is honoured of the lowly.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Seek not out things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are above thy strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be not curious in unnecessary matters: for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For many are deceived by their own vain opinion; and an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Without eyes thou shalt want light: profess not the knowledge therefore that thou hast not.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last; and he that loveth danger shall perish therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy; for the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The heart of the prudent will understand a parable; and an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Water will quench a flaming fire; and alms maketh an atonement for sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter; and when he falleth, he shall find a stay.</p>
