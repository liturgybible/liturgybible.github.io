            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then king Darius gave orders, and they searched in the library of the books that were laid up in Babylon,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there was found in Ecbatana, which is a castle in the province of Media, a book in which this record was written.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the first year of Cyrus the king: Cyrus the king decreed, that the house of God should be built, which is in Jerusalem, in the place where they may offer sacrifices, and that they lay the foundations that may support the height of threescore cubits, and the breadth of threescore cubits,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Three rows of unpolished stones, and so rows of new timber: and the charges shall be given out of the king's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of Cod, which Nabuchodonosor took out of the temple of Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and carried back to the temple of Jerusalem to their place, which also were placed in the temple of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, depart far from them,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And let that temple of God be built by the governor of the Jews, and by their ancients, that they may build that house of God in its place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king's chest, that is, of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocausts to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the custom of the priests that are in Jerusalem, be given them day by day, that there be no complaint in any thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And let them offer oblations to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his children.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I have made a decree: That ii any whosoever, shall alter this commandment, a beam be taken from his house. and set up, and he be nailed upon it, and his house be confiscated.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And may the God, that hath caused his name to dwell there, destroy all kingdoms, and the people that shall put out their hand to resist, and to destroy the house of God, that is in Jerusalem.

            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So then Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors diligently executed what Darius the king had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the ancients of the Jews built and prospered according to the prophecy of Aggeus the prophet, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built and finished, by the commandment of the God of Israel, and by the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of the Persians.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they offered at the dedication of the house of God, a, hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses over the works of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the children of Israel of the captivity kept the phase, 0 on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For all the priests and the Levites were purified as one man: all were clear to kill the phase for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the children of Israel that were returned from captivity, and all that had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of the earth to them, to seek the Lord the God of Israel, did eat.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expences be given out of the king’s house:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.
