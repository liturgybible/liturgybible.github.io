            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he brought me back to the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary, which looked towards the east: and it was shut.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it: because the Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it, and it shall be shut</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the prince. The prince himself shall sit in it, to eat bread before the Lord: he shall enter in by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the same way.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he brought me by the way of the north gate, in the sight of the house: and I saw, and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord: and I fell on my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord said to me: Son of man, attend with thy heart, and behold with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, all that I say to thee concerning all the ceremonies of the house of the Lord, and concerning all the laws thereof: and mark well the ways of the temple, with all the goings out of the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou shalt say to the house of Israel that provoketh me: Thus saith the Lord God: Let all your wicked doings suffice you, 0 house of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In that you have brought in strangers uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, and to defile my house: and you offer my bread, the fat, and the blood: and you have broken my covenant by all your wicked doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And you have not kept the ordinances of my sanctuary: but you have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus saith the Lord God: No stranger uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, no stranger that is in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Moreover the Levites that went away far from me, when the children of Israel went astray, and have wandered from me after their idols, and have borne their iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They shall be officers in my sanctuary, and doorkeepers of the gates of the house, and ministers to the house: they shall slay the holocausts, and the victims of the people: and they shall stand in their sight, to minister to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because they ministered to them before their idols, and were a stumblingblock of iniquity to the house of Israel: therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they shall not come near to me to do the office of priest to me, neither shall they come near to any of my holy things that are by the holy of holies: but they shall bear their shame, and their wickednesses which they have committed.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will make them doorkeepers of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the priests, and Levites, the sons of Sadoc, who kept the ceremonies or my sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me, to minister to me: and they shall stand before me, to offer me the fat, and the blood, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and to keep my ceremonies.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They shall have linen mitres on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins, and they shall not be girded with any thing that causeth sweat.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when they shall go forth to the outward court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them up in the store chamber of the sanctuary, and they shall clothe themselves with other garments: and they shall not sanctify the people with their vestments.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Neither shall they shave their heads, nor wear long heir: but they shall only poll their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And no priest shall drink wine when he is to go into the inner court.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Neither shall they take to wife a widow, nor one that is divorced, but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel: but they may take a widow also, that is, the widow of a priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they shall teach my people the difference between holy and profane, and shew them how to discern between clean and unclean.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when there shall be a controversy, they shall stand in my judgments, and shall judge: they shall keep my laws, and my ordinances in all my solemnities, and sanctify my sabbaths.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they shall come near no dead person, lest they be defiled, only their father and mother, and son and daughter, and brother and sister, that hath not had another husband: for whom they may become unclean.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And after one is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, to the inner court, to minister unto me in the sanctuary, he shall offer for his sin, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they shall have no inheritance, I am their inheritance: neither shall you give them any possession in Israel, for I am their possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> They shall eat the victim both for sin and for trespass: and every vowed thing in Israel shall be theirs.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the firstfruits of all the firstborn, and all the libations of all things that are offered, shall be the priest's: and you shall give the firstfruits of your meats to the priest, that he may return a blessing upon thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or caught by a beast, whether it be fowl or cattle.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.</p>
