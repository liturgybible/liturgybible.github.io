            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are : but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Either three years' famine: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> and David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much se it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sides of gold of just weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>
