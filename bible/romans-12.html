            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</p>
