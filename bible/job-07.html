            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are like the days of a hireling.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling looketh for the end of his work;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to myself wearisome nights.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall arise? and again I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with sorrows even till darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of dust, my skin is withered and drawn together.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by the weaver, and are consumed without any hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember that my life is but wind, and my eyes shall not return to see good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon me, and I shall be no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that shall go down to hell shall not come up.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Nor shall he return my more into his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore I will not spare my month, I will speak in the affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a prison?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be relieved speaking with myself on my couch:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou wilt frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones death.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare me, for my days are nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> What is a man that thou shouldst magnify him? or why dost thou set thy heart upon him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest him suddenly.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow down my spittle?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men? why hast thou set me opposite to thee, and I am become burdensome to myself?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>
