            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For I will not see you now by the way, for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the breatheren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do manfully, and be strengthened.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That you also be subject to such, and to every one that worketh with us, and laboureth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha.</p>
