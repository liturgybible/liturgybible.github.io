            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A slothful man is compared to a filthy stone, and every one will hiss him out to his disgrace.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A slothful man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: every man that takes it up will shake his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> An evilnurtured man is the dishonour of his father that begat him: and a foolish daughter is born to his loss.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that liveth dishonestly is her father’s heaviness.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> She that is bold dishonoureth both her father and her husband, but they both shall despise her.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> A tale out of season is as musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisdom are never out of time.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that telleth a tale to a fool speaketh to one in a slumber: when he hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If children live honestly, and have wherewithal, they shall cover the baseness of their parents.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But children, being haughty, through disdain and want of nurture do stain the nobility of their kindred.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Weep for the dead, for he hath lost the light: and weep for the fool, for he wanteth understanding: make little weeping for the dead, for he is at rest: but the life of the fool is worse than death.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead; but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Talk not much with a fool, and go not to him that hath no understanding: beware of him, lest thou have trouble, and thou shalt never be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, and never be disquieted with madness.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What is heavier than lead? and what is the name thereof, but a fool?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Sand, and salt, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear, than a man without understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As timber girt and bound together in a building cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by advised counsel shall fear at no time.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A heart settled upon a thought of understanding is as a fair plaistering on the wall of a gallery.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Pales set on an high place will never stand against the wind: so a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool cannot stand against any fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He that pricketh the eye will make tears to fall: and he that pricketh the heart maketh it to shew her knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Whoso casteth a stone at the birds frayeth them away: and he that upbraideth his friend breaketh friendship.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despair not: for there may be a returning to favour.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, fear not; for there may be a reconciliation: except for upbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for for these things every friend will depart.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be faithful to thy neighbour in his poverty, that thou mayest rejoice in his prosperity: abide stedfast unto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest be heir with him in his heritage: for a mean estate is not always to be contemned: nor the rich that is foolish to be had in admiration.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire; so reviling before blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> I will not be ashamed to defend a friend; neither will I hide myself from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And if any evil happen unto me by him, every one that heareth it will beware of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly by them, and that my tongue destroy me not?</p>
