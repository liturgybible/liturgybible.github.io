            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to me: If Moses and Samuel shall stand before me, my soul is not towards this people: cast them out from my sight, and let them go forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And if they shall say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Such as are for death, to death: and such as are to the sword, to the sword: and such as are for famine, to famine: and such as are to captivity, to captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will visit them with four kinds, saith the Lord: The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms of the earth: because of Manasses the son of Ezechias the king of Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For who shall have pity on thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go to pray for thy peace?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone backward: and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee: I am weary of entreating thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the land: I have killed and destroyed my people, and yet they are not returned form their ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a spoiler at noonday: I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> She that hath borne seven is become weak, her soul hath fainted away: her sun is gone down, while it was yet day: she is confounded, and ashamed: and the residue of them I will give up to the sword in the sight of their enemies, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Woe is me, my mother: why hast thou borne me a man of strife, a man of contention to all the earth? I have not lent on usury, neither hath any man lent to me on usury: yet all curse me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The Lord saith to me: Assuredly it shall be well with thy remnant, assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction, and in the time of tribulation against the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north, and the brass?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for nothing, because of all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will bring thy enemies out of a land, which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in my rage, it shall burn upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and defend me from them that persecute me, do not defend me in thy patience: know that for thy sake I have sufferred reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was to me a joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name is called upon me, O Lord God of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I sat not in the assembly of jesters, nor did I make a boast of the presence of thy hand: I sat alone, because thou hast filled me with threats.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Why is my sorrow become perpetual, and my wound desperate so as to refuse to be healed? it is become to me as the falsehood of deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord: If thou wilt be converted, I will convert thee, and thou shalt stand before my face; and if thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not be turned to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of brass: and they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail: for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the mighty.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</p>
