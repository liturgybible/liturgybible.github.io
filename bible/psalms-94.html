            <p data-verse="94:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Shall they utter, and speak iniquity: shall all speak who work injustice?</p>
            <p data-verse="94:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thy people, O Lord, they have brought low: and they have afflicted thy inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="94:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They have slain the widow and the stranger: and they have murdered the fatherless.</p>

            <p data-verse="94:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he forsake his own inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="94:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Until justice be turned into judgment: and they that are near it are all the upright in heart.</p>
