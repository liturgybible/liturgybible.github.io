            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in Hebron, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Yesterday also, and the day before when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: for the Lord thy God said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt; be ruler over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So all the ancients of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the Lord: and they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: Thou shalt not come in here. But David took the castle of Sion, which is the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said: Whosoever shall first strike the Jebusites, shall be the head and chief captain. And Joab the son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the general.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was called the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he built the city round about from Mello all round, and Joab built the rest of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David went on growing and increasing, and the Lord of hosts was with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> These are the chief of the valiant men of David, who helped him to be made king over all Israel, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is the number of the heroes of David: Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after him was Eleazar his uncle's son the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philistines were gathered to that place to battle: and the field of that country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But these men stood in the midst of the field, and defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a great deliverance to his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And three of the thirty captains went down to the rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David was in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines in Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David longed, and said: O that some man would give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And these three broke through the midst of the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to drink: and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Saying: God forbid that I should do this in the sight of my God, and should drink the blood of these men: for with the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most valiant.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And illustrious among the second three, and their captain: but yet he attained not to the first three.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Banaias the son of Joiada, a most valiant man, of Cabseel, who had done many acts: he slew the two ariels of Moab: and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature was of five cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver's beam: and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was renowned among the three valiant ones,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three he attained not: and David made him of his council.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</p>
