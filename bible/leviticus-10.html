            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Nadab and Abiu, the sons of Aaron, taking their censers, put fire therein, and incense on it, offering before the Lord strange fire: which was not commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them, and they died before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses said to Aaron: This is what the Lord hath spoken: I will be sanctified in them that approach to me, and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people. And when Aaron heard this, he held his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan, the sons of Oziel, the uncle of Aaron, and said to them: Go and take away your brethren from before the sanctuary, and carry them without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they went forthwith and took them as they lay, vested with linen tunicks, and cast them forth, as had been commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons: Uncover not your heads, and rend not your garments, lest perhaps you die, and indignation come upon all the congregation. Let your brethren, and all the house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle, otherwise you shall perish, for the oil of the holy unction is on you. And they did all things according to the precept of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord also said to Aaron:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make drunk, thou nor thy sons, when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony, lest you die: because it is an everlasting precept through your generations :</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And that you may have knowledge to discern between holy and unholy, between unclean and clean:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And may teach the children of Israel all my ordinances which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons that were left: Take the sacrifice that is remaining of the oblation of the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is holy of holies.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you shall eat it in a holy place: which is given to thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord, as it hath been commanded me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is separated, you shall eat in a most clean place, thou and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside for thee and thy children, of the victims of peace offerings of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Because they have elevated before the Lord the shoulder and the breast, and the fat that is burnt on the altar, and they belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> While these things were a doing, when Moses sought for the buck goat, that had been offered for sin, he found it burnt: and being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, he said:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for sin, which is most holy, and given to you, that you may bear the iniquity of the people, and may pray for them in the sight of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Especially whereas none of the blood thereof hath been carried within the holy places, and you ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, as was commanded me?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Aaron answered: This day hath been offered the victim for sin, and the holocaust before the Lord: and to me what thou seest has happened: how could I eat it, or please the Lord in the ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Which when Moses had heard he was satisfied.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when Moses heard that, he was content.</p>
