            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And all the men were about twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But when some were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord, before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And this continued for the space of two years, so that all they who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And many of them that believed, came confessing and declaring their deeds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And many of them who had followed curious arts, brought together their books, and burnt them before all; and counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So mightily grew the word of God, and was confirmed.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whom he calling together, with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And you see and hear, that this Paul by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: They are not gods which are made by hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing; yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Having heard these things, they were full of anger, and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the whole city was filled with confusion; and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now some cried one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of Jupiter's offspring.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege, nor of blasphemy against your goddess.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p>
