            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron, saying: Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The ancients also of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David to be king over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all Israel and Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the king and all the men that were with him went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land: and they said to David: Thou shalt not come in hither unless thou take away the blind and the lame that say: David shall not come in hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But David took the castle of Sion, the same is the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For David had offered that day a reward to whosoever should strike the Jebusites and get up to the gutters of the tops of the houses, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the soul of David: therefore it is said in the proverb: The blind and the lame shall not come into the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls: and they built a house for David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David knew that the Lord bad confirmed him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom over his people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were born to David other sons also and daughters:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And these are the names of them, that were born to him in Jerusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jebahar, and Elisua, and Nepheg,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Japhia, and Elisama, and Elioda, and Eliphaleth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David to be king over Israel: and they all came to seek David: and when David heard of it, he went down to a strong hold.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Philistines coming spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up to the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to David: Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And David came to Baal Pharisim: and defeated them there, and he said: The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided. Therefore the name of the place was called Baal Pharisim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they left there their idols: which David and his men took away.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Philistines came up again and spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And David consulted the Lord: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? He answered: Go not up against them, but fetch a compass behind them, and thou shalt come upon them over against the pear trees.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle: for then will the Lord go out before thy face to strike the army of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And David did as the Lord had commanded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gabaa until thou come to Gezer.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>
