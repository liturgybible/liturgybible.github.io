            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir to the country of Edom:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Saying: If Esau come to one company and destroy it, the other company that is left shall escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And ye shall add: thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And rising early he took his two wives, and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He remained alone: and behold a man wrestled with him till morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered: I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel: for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Jacob asked him, Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
