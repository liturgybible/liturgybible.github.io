            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother's womb thou art my God,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is none to help me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and roaring.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look towards my defence.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand of the dog.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Save me from the lion's mouth; and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man. Neither hath he turned away his face from me: and when I cried to him he heard me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he shall have dominion over the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made.</p>
