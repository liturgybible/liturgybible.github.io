            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Josue, saying: Speak to the children of Israel and say to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Appoint cities of refuge, a of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That whosoever shall kill a person unawares may flee to them: and may escape the wrath of the kinsman, who is the avenger of blood:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he shall flee to one of these cities: he shall stand before the gate of the city, and shall speak to the ancients of that city, such things as prove him innocent: and so shall they receive him, and give him a place to dwell in.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when the avenger of blood shall pursue him, they shall not deliver him into his hands, because he slew his neighbour unawares, and is not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he shall dwell in that city, till he stand before judgment to give an account of his fact, and till the death of the high priest, who shall be at that time: then shall the manslayer return, and go into his own city and house from whence he fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they appointed Cedes in Galilee of mount Nephtali, and Sichem in mount Ephraim, and Cariath-Arbe, the same is Hebron in the mountain of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And beyond the Jordan to the east of Jericho, they appointed Bosor, which is upon the plain of the wilderness of the tribe of Ruben, and Ramoth in Galaad of the tribe of Cad, and Gaulon in Basan of the tribe of Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> These cities were appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the strangers, that dwelt among them: that whosoever had killed a person unawares might flee to them, and not die by the hand of the kinsman, coveting to revenge the blood that was shed, until he should stand before the people to lay open his cause.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.</p>
