            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless Israel. he went not as he had gone before, to seek divination: but setting his face towards the desert,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon him,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye ire stopped up:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The hearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel!</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waterside.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken awry.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I will speak?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said: Amalec the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and said: Thy habitation in- deed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee captive.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last they themselves also shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.</p>
