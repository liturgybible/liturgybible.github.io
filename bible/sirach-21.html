            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A prayer out of a poor man’s mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh speedily.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that buildeth his house with other men’s money is like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A foolish man’s foot is soon in his neighbour’s house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth.</p>
