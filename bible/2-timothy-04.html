            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</p>

            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
