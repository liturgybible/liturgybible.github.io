            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: You have seen all the things that the Lord did before you in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole land.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The great temptations, which thy eyes have seen, those mighty signs and wonders,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Lord hath not given you al heart to understand, and eyes to see, and ears that may hear, unto this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He hath brought you forty years through the desert: your garments are not worn out, neither are the shoes of your feet consumed with age.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink: that you might know that I am the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And you came to this place: sand Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, came out against us to fight. And we slew them.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to h Ruben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfil them: that you may understand all that you do.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes, and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> , 11Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp, besides the hewers of wood, and them that bring water:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these oaths,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But with all that are present and that are absent.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations: and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless himself in his heart saying: I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the drunken may consume the thirsty,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord should not forgive him: but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him: and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel, according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the following generation shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the nations shall say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume :</p>
            <p data-verse="29:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Secret things to the Lord our God: things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,</p>

            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;</p>

            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>
