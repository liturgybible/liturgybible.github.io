            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be much thanks for thy good deeds.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner: God will repay vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day of vengeance.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Give to the good, and receive not a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done to him: for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not be hidden in adversity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved: and a friend is known in his adversity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Never trust thy enemy: for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ,11Though he humble himself and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat: and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to decline, he will not endure it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> An enemy weepeth with his eyes: but if he find an opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> An enemy hath tears in his eyes, and while he pretendeth to help thee, will undermine thy feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance.</p>
