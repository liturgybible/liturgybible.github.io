            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear this word, ye fat kine that are in the mountains of Samaria: you that oppress the needy, and crush the poor: that say to your masters: Bring, and we will drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and what shall remain of you in boiling pots.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the other, and you shall be cast forth into Armon, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Come ye to Bethel, and do wickedly: to Galgal, and multiply transgressions: and bring in the morning your victims, your tithes in three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven: and call free offerings, and proclaim it: for so you would do, O children of Israel, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereupon I also have given you dulness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet you have not returned to me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon: and the piece whereupon I rained not, withered.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And two and three cities went to one city to drink water, and were not filled: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I struck you with a burning wind, and with mildew, the palmerworm hath eaten up your many gardens, and your vineyards: your olive groves, and fig groves: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I sent death upon you in the way of Egypt, I slew your young men with the sword, even to the captivity of your horses: and I made the stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore I will do these things to thee, O Israel: and after I shall have done these things to thee, be prepared to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind, and declareth his word to man, he that maketh the morning mist, and walketh upon the high places of the earth: the Lord the God of hosts is his name.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.</p>
