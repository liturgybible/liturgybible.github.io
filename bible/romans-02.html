            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who will render to every man according to his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> (For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
