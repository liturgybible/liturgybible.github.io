            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Remember Lot's wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.</p>
