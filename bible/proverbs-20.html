            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As the roaring of a lion, so also is the dread of a king: he that provoketh him, sinneth against his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> It is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels: but all fools are meddling with reproaches.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Because of the cold the sluggard would not plough: he shall beg therefore in the summer, and it shall not be given him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water: but a wise man will draw it out.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Many men are called merciful: but who shall find a faithful man?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The just that walketh in his simplicity, shall leave behind him blessed children.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The king, that sitteth on the throne of judgment, scattereth away all evil with his look.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Diverse weights and diverse measures, both are abominable before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> By his inclinations a child is known, if his works be clean and right.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Love not sleep, lest poverty oppress thee: open thy eyes, and be filled with bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> It is nought, it is nought, saith every buyer: and when he is gone away, then he will boast.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It is ruin to a man to devour holy ones, and after vows to retract.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth over them the wheel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, which searcheth all the hidden things of the bowels.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The joy of young men is their strength: and the dignity of old men, their grey hairs.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils: and stripes in the more in- ward parts of the belly.</p>
