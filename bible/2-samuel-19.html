            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for his son:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day: The king grieveth for his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people shunned the going into the city that day as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away from the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, O Absalom my son, O my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Joab going into the house to the king, said: Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, that have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee: and thou hast shewn this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, nor for thy servants: and I now plainly perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had been slain, then it would have pleased thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants: for I swear to thee by the Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the evils that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then the king arose and sat in the gate: and it was told to all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the people came before the king, but Israel fled to their own dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And all the people were at strife in all the tribes of Israel, saying: The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines: and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And king David sent to Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, saying: Speak to the ancients of Juda, saying: Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? (For the talk of all Israel was come to the king in his house.)</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you the last to bring back the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and my flesh? So do God to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of the army before me always in the place of Joab.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And be inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying: Return thou, and all thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, made haste and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul: and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him: and going over the Jordan,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king's household, and do according to his commandment. And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the king, when he was come over the Jordan,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Said to him: Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the king, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For I thy servant acknowledge my sin: and therefore I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come down to meet my lord the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said: Shall Semei for these words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me? shall there any man be killed this day in Israel? do not I know that this day I am made king over Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he swore unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard: nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his return in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him: Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he answering, said: My lord, O king, my servant despised me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on and go with the king: for I thy servant am lame.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my lord the king: but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do what pleaseth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the guests of thy table: what just complaint therefore have I? or what right to cry any more to the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then the king said to him: Why speakest thou any more? what I have said is determined: thou and Siba divide the possessions.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea, let him take all, for as much as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him beyond the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a man exceeding rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the king said to Berzellai: Come with me that thou mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet and bitter? or can meat or drink delight thy servant? or can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee: I need not this recompense.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And when all the people and the king had passed over the Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him: and he returned to his own place.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now all the people of Juda had brought the king over, and only half of the people of Israel were there.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Therefore all the men of Israel running together to the king, said to him: Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</p>
