            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Contend not with a rich man, lest he bring an action against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For gold and silver hath destroyed many, and hath reached even to the heart of kings, and perverted them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Communicate not with an ignorant man, lest he speak ill of thy family.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Despise not a man that turneth away from sin, nor reproach him therewith: remember that we are all worthy of reproof.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Despise not a man in his old age; for we also shall become old.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Rejoice not at the death of thy enemy; knowing that we all die, and are not willing that others should rejoice at our death.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Despise not the discourse of them that are ancient and wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and instruction of understanding, and to serve great men without blame.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let not the discourse of the ancients escape thee, for they have learned of their fathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give an answer in time of need.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Kindle not the coals of sinners by rebuking them, lest thou be burnt with the flame of the fire of their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Stand not against the face of an injurious person, lest he sit as a spy to entrap thee in thy words.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Lend not to a man that is mightier than thyself: and if thou lendest, count it as lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Be not surety above thy power: and if thou be surety, think as if thou wert to pay it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Judge not against a judge: for he judgeth according to that which is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he burden thee with his evils: for he goeth according to his own will, and thou shalt perish together with his folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Quarrel not with a passionate man, and go not into the desert with a bold man: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help he will overthrow thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Advise not with fools, for they cannot love but such things as please them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Before a stranger do no matter of counsel: for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.</p>
