            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Times are not hid from the Almighty: but they that know him, know not his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Some have removed landmarks, have taken away flocks by force, and fed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have taken away the widow's ox for a pledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They have overturned the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They reap the field that is not their own, and gather the vintage of his vineyard whom by violence they have oppressed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They send men away naked, taking away their clothes who have no covering in the cold:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who are wet, with the showers of the mountains, and having no covering embrace the stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They have violently robbed the fatherless, and stripped the poor common people.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> From the naked and them that go without clothing, and from the hungry they have taken away the ears of corn.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They have taken their rest at noon among the stores of them, who after having trodden the winepresses suffer thirst.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Out of the cities they have made men to groan, and the soul of the wounded hath cried out, and God doth not suffer it to pass unrevenged.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They have been rebellious to the light, they have not known his ways, neither have they returned by his paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The murderer riseth at the very break of day, he killeth the needy, and the poor man: but in the night he will be as a thief.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The eye of the adulterer observeth darkness, saying: No eye shall see me: and he will cover his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He diggeth through houses in the dark, as in the day they had appointed for themselves, and they have not known the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If the morning suddenly appear, it is to them the shadow of death: and they walk in darkness as if it were in light.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He is light upon the face of the water: cursed be his portion on the earth, let him not walk by the way of the vineyards.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let him pass from the snow waters to excessive heat, and his sin even to hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Let mercy forget him: may worms be his sweetness: let him be remembered no more, but be broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For he hath fed the barren that beareth not, and to the widow he hath done no good.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He hath pulled down the strong by his might: and when he standeth up, he shall not trust to his life.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> God hath given him place for penance, and he abuseth it unto pride: but his eyes are upon his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They are lifted up for a little while and shall not stand, and shall be brought down as all things, and shall be taken away, and as the tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And if it be not so, who can convince me that I have lied, and set my words before God?</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>
