            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then the children of Israel, who dwelt in the land of Juda, hearing these things, were exceedingly afraid of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Dread and horror seized upon their minds, lest he should do the same to Jerusalem and to the temple of the Lord, that he had done to other cities and their temples.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they sent into all Samaria round about, as far as Jericho, and seized upon all the tops of the mountains:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they compassed their towns with walls, and gathered together corn for provision for war.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Eliachim the priest wrote to all that were over against Esdrelon, which faceth the great plain near Dothain, and to all by whom there might be a passage of way, that they should take possession of the ascents of the mountains, by which there might be any way to Jerusalem, and should keep watch where the way was narrow between the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the children of Israel did as the priest of the Lord Eliachim had appointed them,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And all the people cried to the Lord with great earnestness, and they humbled their souls in fastings, and prayers, both they and their wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the priests put on haircloths, and they caused the little children to lie prostrate before the temple of the Lord, and the altar of the Lord they covered with haircloth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they cried to the Lord the God of Israel with one accord, that their children might not be made a prey, and their wives carried off, and their cities destroyed, and their holy things profaned, and that they might not be made a reproach to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Eliachim the high priest of the Lord went about all Israel and spoke to them,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Saying: Know ye that the Lord will hear your prayers, if you continue with perseverance in fastings and prayers in the sight of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Remember Moses the servant of the Lord, who overcame Amalec that trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his shields, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen, not by fighting with the sword, but by holy prayers:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So shall all the enemies of Israel be, if you persevere in this work which you have begun.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So they being moved by this exhortation of his, prayed to the Lord, and continued in the sight of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So that even they who offered the holocausts to the Lord, offered the sacrifices to the Lord girded with haircloths, and with ashes upon their head.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they all begged of God with all their heart, that he would visit his people Israel.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endureth for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Turn thee, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that thou mayest be illuminated.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Give not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable unto thee to a strange nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ye were sold to the nations, not for your destruction: but because ye moved God to wrath, ye were delivered unto the enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Ye have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and ye have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought upon me great mourning;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For he hath brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But what can I help you?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Be of good cheer, O my children, cry unto the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come unto you from the Everlasting our Saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Like as now the neighbours of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee; but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, and shalt tread upon his neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry unto God: for ye shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he that hath brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave thee that name will comfort thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and rejoiced at thy fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Miserable are the cities which thy children served: miserable is she that received thy sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> For as she rejoiced at thy ruin, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> O Jerusalem, look about thee toward the east, and behold the joy that cometh unto thee from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Lo, thy sons come, whom thou sentest away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God.</p>
