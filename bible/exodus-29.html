            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when thou hast taken of the blood, that is upon the altar, and of the oil of unction, thou shalt sprinkle Aaron and his vesture, his sons and their vestments. And after they and their vestments are consecrated,</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou shalt take the fat of the ram, and the rump, and the fat that covereth the lungs, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder, because it is the ram of consecration.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And one roll of bread, a cake tempered with oil, a wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread, which is set in the sight of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And thou shalt put all upon the hands of Aaron and of his sons, and shalt sanctify them elevating before the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thou shalt take also the breast of the ram, wherewith Aaron was consecrated, and elevating it thou shalt sanctify it before the Lord, and it shall fall to thy share.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thou shalt sanctify both the consecrated breast, and the shoulder that thou didst separate of the ram,</p>

            <p data-verse="29:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and shalt boil the flesh thereof in the holy place:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Aaron and his sons shall eat it. The loaves also, that are in the basket, they shall eat in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>

            <p data-verse="29:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Seven days shalt thou expiate the altar and sanctify it, and it shall be most holy. Every one that shall touch it shall be holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> This is what thou shalt sacrifice upon the altar: Two lambs of a year old every day continually.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> It is a sacrifice to the Lord, by perpetual oblation unto your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord, where I will appoint to speak unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And there will I command the children of Israel, and the altar shall be sanctified by my glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> I will sanctify also the tabernacle of the testimony with the altar, and Aaron with his sons, to do the office of priesthood unto me.</p>
