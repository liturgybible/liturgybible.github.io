            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The horns whereof went out from the corners, and he overlaid it with plates of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And for the uses thereof, he prepared divers vessels of brass, cauldrons, tongs, fleshhooks, pothooks, and firepans.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he made the grate thereof of brass, in manner of a net, and under it in the midst of the altar a hearth,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the top, to put in bars to carry it.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he made the bars of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of brass:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he drew them through the rings that stood out in the sides of the altar. And the altar itself was not solid, but hollow, of boards, and empty within.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He made also the laver of brass, with the foot thereof, of the mirrors of the women that watch at the door of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He made also the court, in the south side whereof were hangings of fine twisted linen, of a hundred cubits,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Twenty pillars of brass with their sockets, the heads of the pillars, and the whole graving of the work, of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In like manner at the north side the hangings, the pillars, and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the same measure, and work and metal.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But on that side that looketh to the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, ten pillars of brass with their sockets, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of the work, of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Moreover towards the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits:</p>

            <p data-verse="38:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And on the other side (for between the two he made the entry of the tabernacle) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits, and three pillars, and as many sockets.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted linen.</p>

            <p data-verse="38:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he made the heads of the pillars, which also he overlaid with silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And there were offered of brass also seventy-two thousand talents, and four hundred sicles besides.</p>
