            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
