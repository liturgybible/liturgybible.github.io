            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For the sins that you have committed before God, you shall be carried away captives into Babylon by Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when you are come into Babylon, you shall be there many years, and for a long time, even to seven generations: and after that I will bring you away from thence with peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone, and of wood borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and be afraid, and the fear of them should seize upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But when you see the multitude behind, and before, adoring them, say you in your hearts: Thou oughtest to be adored, O Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For my angel is with you: And I myself will demand an account of your souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and themselves laid over with gold and silver, are false things, and they cannot speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay: so do they take gold and make them up.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads: whereof the priests secretly convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it on themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Yea and they give thereof to prostitutes, and they dress out harlots: and again when they receive it of the harlots, they adorn their gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And these gods cannot defend themselves from the rust, and the moth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But when they have covered them with a purple garment, they wipe their face because of the dust of the house, which is very much among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This holdeth a sceptre as a man, as a judge of the country, but cannot put to death one that offendeth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And this hath in his hand a sword, or an axe, but cannot save himself from war, or from robbers, whereby be it known to you, that they are not gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore fear them not. For as a vessel that a man uses when it is broken becometh useless, even so are their gods:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet of them that go in.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the king, or like a dead man carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by thieves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see one: but they are like beams in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts, while they eat them and their garments, and they feel it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Owls, and swallows, and other birds fly upon their bodies, and upon their heads, and cats in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Whereby you may know that they are no gods. Therefore fear them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The gold also which they have, is for shew, but except a man wipe off the rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten, did they feel it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Men buy them at a high price, whereas there is no breath in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders, declaring to men how vile they are. Be they confounded also that worship them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves, nor if a man set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts shall be set before them, as to the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and abuse: in like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either to the sick, or to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The childbearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices: knowing therefore by these things that they are not gods, fear them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For how can they be called gods? because women set offerings before the gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And priests sit in their temples, having their garments rent, and their heads and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The priests take away their garments, and clothe their wives and their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And whether it be evil that one doth unto them, or good, they are not able to recompense it: neither can they set up a king nor put him down:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> In like manner they can neither give riches, nor requite evil. If a man make a vow to them, and perform it not, they cannot require it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> They cannot deliver a man from death nor save the weak from the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> They cannot restore the blind man to his sight: nor deliver a man from distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> They shall not pity the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Their gods, of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like the stones that are hewn out of the mountains: and they that worship them shall be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> How then is it to be supposed, or to be said, that they are gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them: who when they hear of one dumb that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him, that he may speak,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves: and they, when they shall perceive this, will leave them: for their gods themselves have no sense.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The women also with cords about them, sit in the ways, burning olive stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she upbraideth her neighbour, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But all things that are done about them, are false: how is it then to be thought, or to be said, that they are gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else but what the priests will have them to be.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance. Can those things then that are made by them be gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> But they have left false things and reproach to them that come after.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> For when war cometh upon them, or evils, the priests consult with themselves where they may hide themselves with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves from war, nor save themselves from evils?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false things, by all nations and kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Whence therefore is it known that they are not gods, but the work of men's hands, and no work of God is in them?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression; because they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood, and of silver, and of gold, their priests indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And they cannot withstand a king and war. How then can it be supposed, or admitted that they are gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and with silver, able to deliver themselves from thieves or robbers: they that are stronger than them</p>
            <p data-verse="5:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> The sun, and the moon, and the stars being bright, and sent forth for profitable uses, are obedient.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen: and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And the clouds when God commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that which is commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains and woods, doth as it is commanded. But these neither in shew, nor in power are like to any one of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods: since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any good to men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Knowing therefore that they are not gods, fear them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> For neither can they curse kings, nor bless them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> Neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations, nor shine as the sun, nor give light as the moon.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> Beasts are better than they, which can fly under a covert, and help themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods: so fear them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their gods of wood, and of silver, and laid over with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> They are no better than a white thorn in a garden, upon which every bird sitteth. In like manner also their gods of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, are like to a dead body cast forth in the dark.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall know that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and shall be a reproach in the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> Better therefore is the just man that hath no idols: for he shall be far from reproach.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear, and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so far beyond all that they looked for.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes in derision, and a proverb of reproach:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness and destruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there lay no way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a post that hasted by;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neither the pathway of the keel in the waves;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is no token of her way to be found, but the light air being beaten with the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noise and motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards no sign where she went is to be found;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth the air, which immediately cometh together again, so that a man cannot know where it went through:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began to draw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but were consumed in our own wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also is with the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and a beautiful crown from the Lord’s hand: for with his right hand shall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, and make the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and true judgment instead of an helmet.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He shall take holiness for an invincible shield.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the world shall fight with him against the unwise.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and from the clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they fly to the mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stone bow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and the floods shall cruelly drown them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like a storm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste the whole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of the mighty.</p>
