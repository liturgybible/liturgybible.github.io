            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will gather together all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Josaphat: and I will plead with them there for my people, and for my inheritance Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and have parted my land.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they have cast lots upon my people: and the boy they have put in the stews, and the girl they have sold for wine, that they might drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But what have you to do with me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coast of the Philistines? will you revenge yourselves on me? and if you revenge yourselves on me, I will very soon return you a recompense upon your own head.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For you have taken away my silver and my gold: and my desirable and most beautiful things you have carried into your temples.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the children of Juda, and the children of Jerusalem you have sold to the children of the Greeks, that you might remove them far off from their own country.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold, I will raise them up out of the place wherein you have sold them: and I will return your recompense upon your own heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will sell your sons, and your daughters by the hands of the children of Juda, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far off, for the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Proclaim ye this among the nations: prepare war, rouse up the strong: let them come, let all the men of war come up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Cut your ploughshares into swords, and your spades into spears. Let the weak say: I am strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Break forth, and come, all ye nations, from round about, and gather yourselves together: there will the Lord cause all thy strong ones to fall down.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let them arise, and let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I will sit to judge all nations round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Put ye in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe: come and go down, for the press is full, the fats run over: for their wickedness is multiplied.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nations, nations in the valley of destruction: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of destruction.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord shall roar out of Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the heavens and the earth shall be moved, and the Lord shall be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And you shall know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Sion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem shall be holy and strangers shall pass through it no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweetness, and the hills shall flow with milk: and waters shall flow through all the rivers of Juda: and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the torrent of thorns.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a wilderness destroyed: because they have done unjustly against the children of Juda, and have shed innocent blood in their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Judea shall be inhabited for ever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will cleanse their blood which I had not cleansed: and the Lord will dwell in Sion.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p>
