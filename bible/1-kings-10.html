            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the queen of Saba, having; heard of the fame of Solomon in the name of the Lord, came to try him with hard questions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and camels that carried spices, and an immense quantity of gold, and precious stones, she came to king Solomon, and spoke to him all that she had in her heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon informed her of all the things she proposed to him: there was not any word the king was ignorant of, and which he could not answer her.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the meat of his table, and the apartments of his servants, and the order of his ministers, and their apparel, and the cupbearers, and the holocausts, which he offered in the house of the Lord: she had no longer any spirit in her,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And she said to the king: The report is true, which I heard in my own country,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom. And I did not believe them that told me, till I came myself, and saw with my own eyes, and have found that the half hath not been told me: thy wisdom and thy works, exceed the fame which I heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, who stand before thee always, and hear thy wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Blessed be the Lord thy God, whom thou hast pleased, and who hath set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord hath loved Israel for ever, and hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great store, and precious stones: there was brought no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> (The navy also of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir great plenty of thyine trees, and precious stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king made of the thyine trees the rails of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and citterns and harps for singers: there were no such thyine trees as these brought, nor seen unto this day.)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And king Solomon gave the queen of Saba all that she desired, and asked of him: besides what he offered he himself of his royal bounty. And she returned, and went to her own country with her servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Besides that which the men brought him that were over the tributes, and the merchants, and they that sold by retail, and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Solomon made two hundred shields of the purest gold: he allowed six hundred sides of gold for the plates of one shield.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And three hundred targets of fine gold: three hundred pounds of gold covered one target: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Libanus.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> King Solomon also made a great throne of ivory: and overlaid it with the finest gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> It had six steps: and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions stood, one at each hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And twelve little lions stood upon the six steps on the one side and on the other: there was no such work made in any kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Moreover all the vessels, out of which king Solomon drank, were of gold: and all the furniture of the house of the forest of Libanus was of most pure gold: there was no silver, nor was any account made of it in the days of Solomon:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the king's navy, once in three years, went with the navy of Hiram by sea to Tharsis, and brought from thence gold, and silver, and elephants' teeth, and apes, and peacocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches, and wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the earth desired to see Solomon's face, to hear his wisdom, which God had given in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And every one brought him presents, vessels of silver and of gold, garments and armour, and spices, and horses and mules every year.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horseman: and he bestowed them in fenced cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he made silver to be as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones: and cedars to be as common as sycamores which grow in the plains.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And horses were brought for Solomon out of Egypt, and Coa: for the king's merchants brought them out of Coa, and bought them at a set price.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And a chariot of four horses came out of Egypt, for six hundred sides of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And after this manner did all the kings of the Hethites, and of Syria, sell horses.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p>
