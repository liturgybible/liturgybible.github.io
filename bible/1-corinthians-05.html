            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his father's wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And you are puffed up; and have not rather mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For what have I to do to judge them that are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
