            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I understood: and behold a he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</p>
