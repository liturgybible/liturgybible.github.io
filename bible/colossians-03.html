            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter towards them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
