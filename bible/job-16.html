            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have often heard such things as these: you are all troublesome comforters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Shall windy words have no end? or is it any trouble to thee to speak?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I also could speak like you: and would God your soul were for my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I would comfort you also with words, and would wag my head over you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But what shall I do? If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, and all my limbs are brought to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He hath gathered together his fury against me, and threatening me he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me: my enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They have opened their mouths upon me, and reproaching me they have struck me on the cheek, they are filled with my pains.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> God hath shut me up with the unjust man, and hath delivered me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I that was formerly so wealthy, am all on a sudden broken to pieces: he hath taken me by my neck, he hath broken me, and hath set me up to be his mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He hath compassed me round about with his lances, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out my bowels on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He hath torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a giant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyelids are dim.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> These things have I suffered without the iniquity of my hand, when I offered pure prayers to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> O earth, cover not thou my blood, neither let my cry find a hiding place in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that knoweth my conscience is on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> My friends are full of words: my eye poureth out tears to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And O that a man might so be judged with God, as the son of man is judged with his companion!</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For behold short years pass away and I am walking in a path by which l shall not return.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>
