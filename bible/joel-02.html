            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because the day of the Lord cometh, because it is nigh at hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: a numerous and strong people as the morning spread upon the mountains: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, nor shall be after it even to the years of generation and generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can escape it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a kettle.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows as a thief.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceeding great, for they are strong and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and in mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Who knoweth but he will return, and forgive, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bride chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the Lord answered and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will remove far off from you the northern enemy: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I will restore to you the ears which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm have eaten; my great host which I sent upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.</p>
