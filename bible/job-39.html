            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Their young are weaned and go to feed : they go forth, and return not to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his dwellings in the barren land.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the cry of the driver.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh for every green thing.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?</p>

            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining her.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high : she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his nostrils is terror.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed men.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the sword,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When he heareth the trumpet he saith : Ha, ha : he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Her young ones shall suck up blood : and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the Lord went on, and said to Job :</p>
            <p data-verse="39:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then Job answered the Lord, and said :</p>
            <p data-verse="39:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said : and another, to which I will add no more.</p>
