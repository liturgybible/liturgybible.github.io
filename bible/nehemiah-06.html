            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Sanaballat and Gossem Rent to me, saying: Come, and let us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come, and go down to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them after the same manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them : for which end</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel together.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off. Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia, the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I said: Should such a man as I Bee? and who is there that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I will not go in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was the work of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came letters to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they praised him also before me, and they related my words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in fear.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p>
