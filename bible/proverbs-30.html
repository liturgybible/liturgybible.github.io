            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter. The vision which the man spoke with whom God is, and who being strengthened by God, abiding with him, said:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I am the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? who hath held the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buckler to them that hope in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved, and found a liar:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Remove far from me vanity, and lying words. Give me neither beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say: Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and forswear the name of my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and their eyelids lifted up on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A generation, that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their jaw teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The horseleech hath two daughters that say: Bring, bring. There are three things that never are satisfied, and the fourth never saith: It is enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Hell, and the mouth of the womb, and the earth which is not satisfied with water: and the fire never saith: It is enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labour of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Three things are hard to me, and the fourth I am utterly ignorant of.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man in youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Such is also the way of an adulterous woman, who eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith: I have done no evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> By a slave when he reigneth: by a fool when he is filled with meat:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> By an odious woman when she is married: and by a bondwoman when she is heir to her mistress.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> There are four very little things of the earth, and they are wiser than the wise:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The ants, a feeble people, which provide themselves food in the harvest:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The rabbit, a weak people, which maketh its bed in the rock:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The locust hath no king, yet they all go out by their bands.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The stellio supporteth itself on hands, and dwelleth in kings' houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that walketh happily:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he meeteth:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none can resist.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he that strongly squeezeth the papa to bring out milk, straineth out butter: and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood: and he that provoketh wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Two things have I required of thee; deny me them  not before I die:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</p>
            <p data-verse="30:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is  no rising up.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</p>
