            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that hath a mind to depart from a friend seeketh occasions: he shall ever be subject to reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A fool receiveth not the words of prudence: unless thou say those things which are in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The wicked man when he is come into the depth of sine, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Words from the mouth of a men are as deep water: and the fountain of wisdom as an overflowing stream.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to decline from the truth of judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The lips of a fool intermeddle with strife: and his mouth provoketh quarrels.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The mouth of a fool is his destruction: and his lips are the ruin of his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless: and they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels. Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that is loose and slack in his work, is the brother of him that wasteth his own works.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the just runneth to it, and shall be exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The substance of the rich man is the city of his strength, and as a strong wall compassing him about.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Before destruction, the heart of a man is exalted: and before he be glorified, it is humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that answereth before he heareth sheweth himself to be a fool, and worthy of confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The spirit of a man upholdeth his infirmity: but a spirit that is easily angered, who can bear?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A man's gift enlargeth his may, and maketh him room before princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The lot suppresseth contentions, and determineth even between the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A brother that is helped by his brother, is like a strong city: and judgments are like the bars of cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Of the fruit of a man's mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and the offspring of his lips shall fill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: they that love it, shall eat the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and shall receive a pleasure from the Lord. He that driveth away a good wife, driveth away a good thing: but he that keepeth an adulteress, is foolish and wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The poor will speak with supplications, and the rich will speak roughly.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</p>
