            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the sine of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the life of the prince shall be prolonged.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep it, are incensed against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord, take notice of all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity, than the rich in crooked ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He that keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that feedeth gluttons, shameth his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them for him that will be bountiful to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer shall be as abomination.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way, shall fall in his own destruction: and the upright shall possess his goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The rich man seemeth to himself wise: but the poor man that is prudent shall search him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> In the joy of the just there is great glory: when the wicked reign, men are ruined.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he that hateth covetousness, shall prolong his days.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee even to the pit, no man will stay him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A man, that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that boasteth, and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh wisely, he shall be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He that giveth to the poor, shall not want: he that despiseth his entreaty, shall suffer indigence.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they perish, the lust shall be multiplied.</p>
