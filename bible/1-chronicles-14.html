            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>
