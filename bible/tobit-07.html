            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Justify not thyself before God, for he knoweth the heart: and desire not to appear wise before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to extirpate iniquities: lest thou fear the person of the powerful, and lay a stumblingblock for thy integrity.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Offend not against the multitude of a city, neither cast thyself in upon the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Nor bind sin to sin: for even in one thou shalt not be unpunished.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be not fainthearted in thy mind:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Neglect not to pray, and to give alms.</p>
