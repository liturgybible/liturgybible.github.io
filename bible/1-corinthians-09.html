            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Am not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> My defence with them that do examine me is this.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Have not we power to eat and to drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who serveth as a soldier at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Know you not, that they who work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar, partake with the altar?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel, should live by the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die, rather than that any man should make my glory void.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I became to the Jews, a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I do all things for the gospel's sake: that I may be made partaker thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize ? So run that you may obtain.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible one.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Have we not power to eat and to drink?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</p>
