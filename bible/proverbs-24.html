            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak deceits.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be strengthened.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious and most beautiful wealth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A wise man is strong: and a knowing man, stout and valiant.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Because war is managed by due ordering: and there shall be safety where there are many counsels.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wisdom is too high for a fool, in the gate he shall not open his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that deviseth to do evils, shall be called a fool.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The thought of a fool is sin: and the detracter is the abomination of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death forbear not to deliver.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou say: I have not strength enough: he that seeth into the heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul, end he shall render to a man according to his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Fat honey, my son, because it is good, and the honeycomb most sweet to thy throat:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou hast found, thou shalt have hope in the end, and thy hope shall not perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Lie not in wait, nor seek after wickedness in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For a just mall shall fall seven times and shall rise again: but the wicked shall fall down into evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When thy enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not thy heart rejoice:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Lest the Lord see, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Contend not with the wicked, nor seek to be like the ungodly:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For evil men have no hope of things to come, and the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> My son, fear the Lord and the king: and have nothing to do with detracters.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For their destruction shall rise suddenly: and who knoweth the ruin of both?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> These things also to the wise: It is not good to have respect to persons in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They that say to the wicked man: Thou art just: shall be cursed by the people, and the tribes shall abhor them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> They that rebuke him, shall be praised: and a blessing shall come upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Prepare thy work without, and diligently till thy ground: that afterward thou mayst build thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: and deceive not any man with thy lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Say not: I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to every one according to his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of the foolish man:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And behold it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Which when I had seen, I laid it up in my heart, and by the example I received instruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an armed man.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not  he know it? and shall not he render to every  man according to his works?</p>

            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> These things also belong to the wise. It is  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
