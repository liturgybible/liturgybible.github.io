            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And every man returned to his own house.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And every man went unto his own house.</p>
