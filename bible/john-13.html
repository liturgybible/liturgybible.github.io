            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</p>

            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>

            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</p>
