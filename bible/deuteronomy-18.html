            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they shall receive nothing else. of the possession of their brethren: for the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he hath said to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> This shall be the priest's due from the people, and from them that offer victims: whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep, they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The firstfruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a part of the wool from the shearing of their sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes, to stand and to minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all Israel, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come to the place which the Lord shall choose,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do: besides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from his fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee, beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the abominations of those nations.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a PROPHET of thy nation and of thy brethren like unto me: him thou shalt hear:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the assembly was gathered together, and saidst: Let me not hear any more the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this exceeding great fire, lest I die.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the Lord said to me: They have spoken all things well.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> m I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their brethren like to thee: and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak in my name, I will be the revenger.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the prophet, who being corrupted with pride, shall speak in my name things that I did not command him to say, or in the name of strange gods, shall be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And if in silent thought thou answer: How shall I know the word that the Lord hath not spoken?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou shalt have this sign: Whatsoever that same prophet foretelleth in the name of the Lord, and it cometh not to pass: that thing the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath forged it by the pride of his mind: and therefore thou shalt not fear him.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD shall choose;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which they have spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</p>
