            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book :</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said to me: Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee. And I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear and will forbear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
