            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel wits not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood. and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou wast naked, and full of confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers : and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shed thee with violet coloured shoes : and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine hour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast committed fornication with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them : and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and best sacrificed the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe to thee, saith the Lord God)</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satisfied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans: and neither so wast then satisfied.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith the Lord God: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But as an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication: for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou hast hated: and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> ,41And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And my indignation shall rest in thee: and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their wickednesses: thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways</p>
            <p data-verse="16:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> as I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And they were lifted up, and committed abominations before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Samaria committed not half thy sins: but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abominations which thou hast done.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sine, doing more wickedly than they: for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom, with her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day of thy pride,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> Before thy malice was laid open: as it is at this time, making thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Palestine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> For thus saith the Lord God: I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed: when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)</p>
            <p data-verse="16:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!</p>
            <p data-verse="16:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
