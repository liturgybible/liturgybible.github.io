            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom, Baasa the king of Israel came up against Juda, and built a wall about Rama, that no one might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of Asa.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's treasures, and sent to Benadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father, wherefore I have sent thee silver and gold, that thou mayst break thy league with Baasa king of Israel, and make him depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And then Benadad heard this, he sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel: and they took Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Nephtali.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Baasa heard of it, he left off the building of Rama, and interrupted his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then king Asa took all Juda, and they carried away from Rama the stones, and the timber that Baasa had prepared for the building: and he built with them Gabaa, and Maspha.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> At that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa king of Juda, and said to him: Because thou hast had confidence in the king of Syria, and not in the Lord thy God, therefore hath the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Were not the Ethiopians, and the Libyans much more numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceeding great multitude: yet because thou trustedst in the Lord, he delivered them into thy hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the eyes of the Lord behold all the earth, and give strength to those who with a perfect heart trust in him. Wherefore thou hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this time wars shall arise against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Asa was angry with the seer, and commanded him to be put in prison: for he was greatly enraged because of this thing: and he put to death many of the people at that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the works of Asa the first and last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, of a most violent pain in his feet, and yet in his illness he did not seek the Lord, but rather trusted in the skill of physicians.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he slept with his fathers: and he died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had made for himself in the city of David: and they laid him on his bed full of spices and odoriferous ointments, which were made by the art of the perfumers, and they burnt them over him with very great pomp.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.</p>
