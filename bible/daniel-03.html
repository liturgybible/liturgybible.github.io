            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> King Nabuchodonosor made a statue of gold, of sixty cubits high, and six cubits broad, and he set it up in the plain of Dura of the province of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, the rulers, and governors, and all the chief men of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the nobles, the magistrates, and the judges, the captains, and rulers, and the great men that were placed in authority, and all the princes of the provinces, were gathered together to come to the dedication of the statue, which king Nabuchodonosor had set up. And they stood before the statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then a herald cried with a strong voice: To you it is commanded, O nations, tribes, and languages:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That in the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, and of the flute, and of the harp, of the sackbut, and of the psaltery, and of the symphony, and of all kind of music; ye fall down and adore the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor hath set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But if any man shall not fall down and adore, he shall the same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Upon this therefore, at the time when all the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music: all the nations, tribes, and languages fell down and adored the golden statue which king Nabuchodonosor had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And presently at that very time some Chaldeans came and accused the Jews,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And said to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou, O king, hast made a decree that every man that shall bear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, and the harp, of the sackbut, and the psaltery, of the symphony, and of all kind of music, shall prostrate himself, and adore the golden statue:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And that if any man shall not fall down and adore, he should be cast into a furnace of burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now there are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, O king, have slighted thy decree: they worship not thy gods, nor do they adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Nabuchodonosor the king spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now therefore if you be ready at what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answered and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For behold our God, whom we worship, is able to save us from the furnace of burning fire, and to deliver us out of thy hands, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But if he will not, be it known to thee, O king, that we will not worship thy gods, nor adore the golden statue which thou hast set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then was Nabuchodonosor filled with fury: and the countenance of his face was changed against Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more than it had been accustomed to be heated.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And immediately these men were bound and were cast into the furnace of burning fire, with their coats, and their caps, and their shoes, and their garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. And the flame of the fire slew those men that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, fell down bound in the midst of the furnace of burning fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, and said: True, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He answered, and said: Behold I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Nabuchodonosor came to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and said: Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, ye servants of the most high God, go ye forth, and come. And immediately Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago went out from the midst of the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the nobles, and the magistrates, and the judges, and the great men of the king being gathered together, considered these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, and that not a hair of their head had been singed, nor their garments altered, nor the smell of the fire had passed on them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king's word, and delivered up their bodies that they might not serve, nor adore any god, except their own God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> By me therefore this decree is made, that every people, tribe, and tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, shall be destroyed, and their houses laid waste: for there is no other God that can save in this manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then the king promoted Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, in the province of Babylon.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</p>
