            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel Beat their bread all filthy among the nations whither I will cast them out.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</p>
