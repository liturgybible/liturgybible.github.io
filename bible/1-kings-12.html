            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither were all Israel come together to make him king.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was yet in Egypt, a fugitive from the face of king Solomon, hearing of his death, returned out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they sent and called him: and Jeroboam came, and all the multitude of Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy father laid a grievous yoke upon us: now therefore do thou take off a little of the grievous service of thy father, and of his most heavy yoke, which he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said to them: Go till the third day, and come to me again. And when the people was gone,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> King Roboam took counsel with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and he said: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They said to him: If thou wilt yield to this people to day, and condescend to them, and grant their petition, and wilt speak gentle words to them, they will be thy servants always.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he left the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and stood before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to them: What counsel do you give me, that I may answer this people, who have said to me: Make the yoke which thy father put upon us lighter?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the young men that had been brought up with him, said: Thus shalt thou speak to this people, who have spoken to thee, saying: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease us. Thou shalt say to them: My little finger is thicker than the back of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now my father put a, heavy yoke upon you, but I will add to your yoke: my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying: Come to me again the third day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the king answered the people roughly, leaving the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying: My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke: my father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king condescended not to the people: for the Lord was turned away from him, to make good his word, which he had spoken in the hand of Ahias the Silonite, to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then the people seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered him, saying : What portion have we in David? or what inheritance in the son of Isai? Go home to thy dwellings, O Israel, now David look to thy own house. So Israel departed to their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But as for all the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda, Roboam reigned over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all Israel stoned him, and he died. Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get him up into his chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Israel revolted from the house of David, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they gathered an assembly, and sent and called him, and made him king over all Israel, and there was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Juda only.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered together all the house of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred four- score thousand chosen men for war, to fight against the house of Israel and to bring the kingdom again under Roboam the son of Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the word of the Lord came to Semeias the man of God, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, the king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda, and Benjamin, and the rest of the people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: let every man return to his house, for this thing is from me. They hearkened to the word of the Lord, and returned from their journey, as the Lord had commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Jeroboam built Sichem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt there, and going out from thence he built Phanuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Jeroboam said in his heart: Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem: and the heart of this people will turn to their lord Roboam the king of Juda, and they will kill me, and return to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And finding out a device he made two golden calves, and said to them: Go ye up no more to Jerusalem: Behold thy gods, O Israel, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he set the one in Bethel, and the other in Dan:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And this thing became an occasion of sin: for the people went to adore the calf as far as Dan.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he made temples in the high places, and priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, after the manner of the feast that was celebrated in Juda. And going up to the altar, he did in like manner in Bethel, to sacrifice to the calves, which he had made : and he placed in Bethel priests of the high places, which he had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he went up to the altar, which he had built in Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, which he had devised of his own heart: and he ordained a feast to the children of Israel, and went upon the altar to burn incense.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</p>
