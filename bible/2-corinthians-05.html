            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore having always confidence, knowing that, while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> (For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
