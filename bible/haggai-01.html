            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith: The time is not yet come for building the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this house lie desolate?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to consider your ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, but have not had enough: you have drunk, but have not been filled with drink: you have clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed: and he that hath earned wages, put them into a bag with holes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set Your hearts upon your ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house: and it shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and you brought it home, and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of hosts? because my house is desolate, and you make haste every man to his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew, and the earth was hindered from yielding her fruits:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon all that the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon all the labour of the hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of Aggeus the prophet, as the Lord their God sent him to them: and the people feared before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of the Lord, spoke, saying to the people: I am with you, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel governor of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people: and they went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then spake Haggai the LORD’S messenger in the LORD’S message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.</p>
