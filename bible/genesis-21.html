            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father was Isaac born.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Abraham took this grievously for his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Abraham said: I will swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because both of them did swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they made a league for the well of oath.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.</p>
