            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it shall come to pass, that as a bird fleeing away, and as young ones flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be in the passage of Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Take counsel, gather a council: make thy shadow as the night in the midday: hide them that flee, and betray not them that wander about.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My fugitives shall dwell with thee: O Moab, be thou a covert to them from the face of the destroyer: for the dust is at an end, the wretch is consumed: he hath failed, that trod the earth under foot.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And a throne shall be prepared in mercy, and one shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment and quickly rendering that which is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his pride and his arrogancy, and his indignation is more than his strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab, every one shall howl: to them that rejoice upon the brick walls, tell ye their stripes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the suburbs of Hesebon are desolate, and the lords of the nations have destroyed the vineyard of Sabama: the branches thereof have reached even to Jazer: they have wandered in the wilderness, the branches thereof are left, they are gone over the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore I will lament with the weeping of Jazer the vineyard of Sabama: I will water thee with my tears, O Hesebon, and Eleale: for the voice of the treaders hath rushed in upon thy vintage, and upon thy harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And gladness and joy shall be taken away from Carmel, and there shall be no rejoicing nor shouting in the vineyards. He shall not tread out wine in the press that was wont to tread it out: the voice of the treaders I have taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for the brick wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is wearied on his high places, that he shall go in to his sanctuaries to pray, and shall not prevail.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This is the word, that the Lord spoke to Moab from that time:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And now the Lord hath spoken, saying: In three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be taken away for all the multitude of the people, and it shall be left small and feeble, not many.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.</p>
