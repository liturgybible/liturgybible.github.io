            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid. But by their offence, salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world, and the diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much more the fulness of them?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For I say to you, Gentiles: as long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the root, and of the fatness of the olive tree,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps he also spare not thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>

            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
