            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there was a famine in the days of David for three years successively: and David consulted the oracle of the Lord. And the Lord said: It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he slew the Gabaonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them: (Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Amorrhites: I and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for the children of Israel and Juda:)</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> David therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? and what shall be the atonement for you, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about silver and gold, but against Saul and against his house: neither do we desire that any man be slain of Israel. And the king said to them: What will you then that I should do for you?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify them to the Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen of the Lord. And the king said: I will give them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord, that had been between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Hadriel the son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: and they crucified them on a hill before the Lord: and these seven died together in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to be reaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Respha the daughter of Aia took haircloth, and spread it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till water dropped upon them out of heaven: and suffered neither the birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it was told David, what Respha the daughter of Aia, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen them from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged them when they had slain Saul in Gelboe.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he brought from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered up the bones of them that were crucified,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they buried them with the bones of Saul, and of Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in the side, in the sepulchre of Cis his father: and they did all that the king had commanded, and God shewed mercy again to the land after these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Philistines made war again against Israel, and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines. And David growing faint,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Arapha, the iron of whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, being girded with a new sword, attempted to kill David.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking the Philistine killed him. Then David's men swore unto him, saying: Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the lamp of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There was also a second battle in Gob against the Philistines: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of Arapha of the family of the giants.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And there was a third battle in Gob against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an embroiderer of Bethlehem slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A fourth battle was in Geth. where there was a man of great stature, that had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot, four and twenty in all, and he was of the race of Arapha.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he reproached Israel: and Jonathan the son of Samae the brother of David slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by the hand of David, and of his servants.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Ishbi-benob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
