            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For I would have you know, what manner of care I have for you and for them that are at Laodicea, and whosoever have not seen my face in the flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed in charity, and unto all riches of fulness of understanding, unto the knowledge of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness of words.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am with you; rejoicing, and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith which is in Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned, abounding in him in thanksgiving.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy, and vain deceit; according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Buried with him in baptism, in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him up from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you, when you were dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh; he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbaths,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Let no man seduce you, willing in humility, and religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain puffed up by the sense of his flesh,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And not holding the head, from which the whole body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the increase of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If then you be dead with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Touch not, taste not, handle not:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Which all are unto destruction by the very use, according to the precepts and doctrines of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of the flesh.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</p>

            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:</p>

            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</p>
