            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Great travail is created for every man, and an heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother’s womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Their imagination of things to come, and the day of death, trouble their thoughts, and cause fear of heart;</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, unto him that is humbled in earth and ashes;</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> From him that weareth purple and a crown, unto him that is clothed with a linen frock.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wrath, and envy, trouble, and unquietness, fear of death, and anger, and strife, and in the time of rest upon his bed his night sleep, do change his knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> A little or nothing is his rest, and afterward he is in his sleep, as in a day of keeping watch, troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he were escaped out of a battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When all is safe, he awaketh, and marvelleth that the fear was nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Such things happen unto all flesh, both man and beast, and that is sevenfold more upon sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword, calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge;</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> These things are created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> All things that are of the earth shall turn to the earth again: and that which is of the waters doth return into the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> All bribery and injustice shall be blotted out: but true dealing shall endure for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The goods of the unjust shall be dried up like a river, and shall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in rain.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> While he openeth his hand he shall rejoice: so shall transgressors come to nought.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The children of the ungodly shall not bring forth many branches: but are as unclean roots upon a hard rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The weed growing upon every water and bank of a river shall be pulled up before all grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Bountifulness is as a most fruitful garden, and mercifulness endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a sweet life: but he that findeth a treasure is above them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Children and the building of a city continue a man’s name: but a blameless wife is counted above them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wine and musick rejoice the heart: but the love of wisdom is above them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The pipe and the psaltery make sweet melody: but a pleasant tongue is above them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thine eye desireth favour and beauty: but more than both corn while it is green.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> A friend and companion never meet amiss: but above both is a wife with her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Brethren and help are against time of trouble: but alms shall deliver more than them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Gold and silver make the foot stand sure: but counsel is esteemed above them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Riches and strength lift up the heart: but the fear of the Lord is above them both: there is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek help.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The fear of the Lord is a fruitful garden, and covereth him above all glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> My son, lead not a beggar’s life; for better it is to die than to beg.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The life of him that dependeth on another man’s table is not to be counted for a life; for he polluteth himself with other men’s meat: but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shameless: but in his belly there shall burn a fire.</p>
