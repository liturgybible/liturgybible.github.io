            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy soul, pitying thy youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in the desert, in a land that is not sown.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Israel is holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his increase: all they that devour him offend: evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all ye families of the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord: What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they have not said: Where is the Lord, that made us come up out of the land of Egypt? that led us through the desert, through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of drought, and the image of death, through a land wherein no man walked, nor any man dwelt?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the fruit thereof, and the best things thereof: ad when ye entered in, you defiled my land, and made my inheritance an abomination.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The priests did not say: Where is the Lord? and they that held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me: and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore will I yet contend in judgement with you, saith the Lord, and I will plead with your children.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see: and send into Cedar, and consider diligently: and see if there hath been done any thing like this.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are not gods,: but my people have changed their glory into an idol.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Is Israel a bondman, or a homeborn slave? why then is he become prey?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise, they have made his land a wilderness: his cities are burnt down and there is none to dwell in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have deflowered thee, even to the crown of the head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the way?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not with thee, saith the Lord the God of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. For on every high hill, and under every green tree thou didst prostitute thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yet I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed: how then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O strange vineyard?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before me, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> How canst thou say: I am not polluted, and I have not walked after Baalim? see thy ways in the valley, know what thou hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love: none shall turn her away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they shall find her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from thirst. But thou saidst: I have lost all hope, I will not do it: for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes and their priests, and their prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Saying to a stock: Thou art my father: and to a stone: thou hast begotten me: they have turned their back to me, and not their face: and in the time of their affliction they will say: Arise, and deliver us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Where are the gods, whom thou hast made thee? let them arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction: for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Why will you contend with me in judgement? you have all forsaken me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In vain have I struck your children, they have not received correction: your sword hath devoured your prophets, your generation is like a ravaging lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> See ye the word of the Lord: Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a lateward springing land? why then have my people said: We are revolted, we will come to thee no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her stomacher? but my people hath forgotten me days without number.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Why dost thou endeavor to shew thy way good to seek my love, thou who has also taught thy malices to be thy ways,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor and innocent? not in ditches have I found them, but in all places, which I mentioned before.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And thou hast said: I am without sin and am innocent: and therefore let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will contend with thee in judgement, because thou hast said: I have not sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> How exceeding base art thou become, going the same ways over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon thy head: for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt have nothing prosperous therein.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children’s children will I plead.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</p>
