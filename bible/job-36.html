            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee : for I have yet somewhat to speak in God's behalf.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty :</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He also shall open their ear, to correct them : and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it : and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man : neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity : for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him : Thou has wrought iniquity?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which men have sung.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge : the number of his years is inestimable.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods :</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> If he will spread out clouds as his tent,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it.</p>

            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>
