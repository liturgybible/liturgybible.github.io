            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And here indeed, men that die, receive thithes: but there he hath witness, that he liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> (For the law brought nothing to perfection,) but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, in offering himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>
