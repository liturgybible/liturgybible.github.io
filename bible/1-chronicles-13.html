            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with all the commanders.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to all the assembly of Israel: If it please you; and if the words which I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to us,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we sought it not in the days of Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all the multitude answered that it should be so: for the word pleased all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt, even to the entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from Cariathiarim.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David went up with all the men of Israel to the hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is called upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, out of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove the cart.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David and all Israel played before God with all their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had made it lean a little on one side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him, because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David was troubled because the Lord had divided Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I bring in the ark of God to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gethite.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he had.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.</p>
