            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face, and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do also towards you,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.</p>
