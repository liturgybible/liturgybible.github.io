            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> O little ones, understand subtilty, and ye unwise, take notice.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ,11For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I wisdom dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The fear of the Lord hateth evil: I hate arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I love them that love me: and they that in the morning early watch for me, shall find me.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my blossoms than choice silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>

            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived. neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established: before the hills I was brought forth:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when be balanced the foundations of the earth;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now therefore, ye children, hear me: Blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But he that shall sin against me, shall hurt his own soul. All that hate me love death.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</p>
