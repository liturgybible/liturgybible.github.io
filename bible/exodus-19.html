            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the third month of the departure of Israel out of the land of Egypt, on this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, and there Israel pitched their tents over against the mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses went up to God: and the Lord called unto him from the mountain, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you to myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people: for all the earth is mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And you shall be to me a priestly kingdom, and a holy nation. Those are the words thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moses came, and calling together the elders of the people, he declared all the words which the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the people answered together: All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do. And when Moses had related the people's words to the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And let them be ready against the third day: for on the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed you go not up into the mount, and that ye touch not the borders thereof: every one that toucheth the mount dying he shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Moses came down from the mount to the people, and sanctified them. And when they had washed their garments,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and come not near your wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And now the third day was come, and the morning appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the mount, and the noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud, and the people that was in the camp, feared.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all mount Sinai was on a smoke: because the Lord was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke, and God answered him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, in the very top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And when he was gone up thither,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people: lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the Lord, and a very great multitude of them should perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be sanctified, lest he strike them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou did charge, and command, saying: Set limits about the mount, and sanctify it.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the Lord, lest he kill them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Moses went down to the people and told them all.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</p>
