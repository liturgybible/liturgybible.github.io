            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day, saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I will never forget all their works.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for thirst.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</p>
