            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But if thou wilt not let them go behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs: which shall come up, and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and in the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the frogs shall come in to thee and to thy people, and to all thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand upon the streams and upon the rivers and the pools, and bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the magicians also by their enchantments did in like manner, and the brought forth frogs upon all the land of Egypt</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Pharao called Moses and Aaron and said to them: Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses said to Pharao: Set me a time when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people: and may remain only in the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he answered: Tomorrow. But he said: I will do according to thy word; that thou mayst know that there is none like to the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and shall remain only in the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao: and Moses cried to the Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharao concerning the frogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land was corrupted.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Pharao seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart, and did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth: and may there be sciniphs in all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rod: and he struck the dust of the earth, and there came sciniphs on men and on beasts: all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs through all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the magicians with their enchantments practiced in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not and there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the magicians said to Pharao This is the finger of God. And Pharao heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The Lord also said to Moses: Arise early, and stand before Pharao: for he will go forth to the waters: and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses all kind of flies: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I will make the land of Gessen wherein my people is, wonderful in that lay, so that flies shall not be there: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the Lord did so. And there came a very grievous swarm of flies into he houses of Pharao and of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt: and the land was corrupted by this kind of flies.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go, and sacrifice to your God in this land.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Moses said: It cannot be so: for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship, in their presence, they will stone us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness: and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Pharao said: I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness: but go no farther: pray for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said: I will go out from thee, and will pray to the Lord: and the flies shall depart from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people tomorrow: but do not deceive any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> So Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he did according to his word: and he took away the flies from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people: there was not left so much as one.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Pharao's heart was hardened, so that neither this time would he let the people go.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</p>
