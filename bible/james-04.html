            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You covet, and have not: you kill, and envy, and can not obtain. You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world, becometh an enemy of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be subject therefore to God, but resist the devil, and he will fly from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> There is one lawgiver, and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year, and will traffic, and make our gain.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</p>
