            <p data-verse="105:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Sing to him, yea sing praises to him: relate all his wondrous works.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened: seek his face evermore.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Remember his marvellous works which he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> O ye seed of Abraham his servant; ye sons of Jacob his chosen.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He hath remembered his covenant for ever: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Which he made to Abraham; and his oath to Isaac:</p>
            <p data-verse="105:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he appointed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting testament:</p>
            <p data-verse="105:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the lot of your inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When they were but a small number: yea very few, and sojourners therein:</p>
            <p data-verse="105:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He suffered no man to hurt them: and he reproved kings for their sakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Touch ye not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he called a famine upon the land: and he broke in pieces all the support of bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He sent a man before them: Joseph, who was sold for a slave.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They humbled his feet in fetters: the iron pierced his soul,</p>
            <p data-verse="105:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> until his word came. The word of the Lord inflamed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The king sent, and he released him: the ruler of the people, and he set him at liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He made him master of his house, and ruler of all his possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That he might instruct his princes as himself, and teach his ancients wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Israel went into Egypt: and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies,</p>
            <p data-verse="105:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He turned their heart to hate his people: and to deal deceitfully with his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He sent Moses his servant: Aaron the man whom he had chosen.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He gave them power to shew his signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He sent darkness, and made it obscure: and grieved not his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He turned their waters into blood, and destroyed their fish.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Their land brought forth frogs, in the inner chambers of their kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He spoke, and there came divers sorts of flies and sciniphs in all their coasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He gave them hail for rain, a burning fire in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he destroyed their vineyards and their fig trees: and he broke in pieces the trees of their coasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> He spoke, and the locust came, and the bruchus, of which there was no number.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they devoured all the grass in their land, and consumed all the fruit of their ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he slew all the firstborn in their land: the firstfruits of all their labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he brought them out with silver and gold: and there was not among their tribes one that was feeble.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them lay upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to give them light in the night.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> They asked, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> He opened the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran down in the dry land.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Because he remembered his holy word, which he had spoken to his servant Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness.</p>
            <p data-verse="105:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he gave them the lands of the Gentiles: and they possessed the labours of the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="105:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> That they might observe his justifications, and seek after his law.</p>
