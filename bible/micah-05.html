            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> AND THOU, BETHLEHEM Ephrata, art a little one among the thousands of Juda: out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be the ruler in Israel: and his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth: and the remnant of his brethren shall be converted to the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he shall stand, and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the height of the name of the Lord his God: and they shall be converted, for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And this man shall be our peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall set his foot in our houses: and we shall raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they shall feed the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nemrod with the spears thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our borders.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as a dew from the Lord, and as drops upon the grass, which waiteth not for man, nor tarrieth for the children of men.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</p>
