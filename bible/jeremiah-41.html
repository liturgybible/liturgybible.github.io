            <p data-verse="41:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath: and they ate bread there together in Masphath.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten men that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the soldiers.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it,</p>
            <p data-verse="41:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and mourning: and they had offerings and incense in their hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of Ahicam.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel : Kill us not: for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of Israel: the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath : the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Masphath: whom Nabuzardan the general of the army had committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel the son of Nathanias had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And taking all the men, they went out to fight against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great waters that are in Gabaon.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men that were with him, they rejoiced.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to Masphath: and they returned and went to Johanan the son of Caree.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom they had recovered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias, from Masphath, after that he had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam: valiant men for war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gabaon:</p>
            <p data-verse="41:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam, which is near Bethlehem: in order to go forward, and enter into Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="41:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> From the face of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land of Juda.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</p>
            <p data-verse="41:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</p>
            <p data-verse="41:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.</p>
