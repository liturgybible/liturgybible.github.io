            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered , and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But you have set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold I cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They that dwelt in my house, and my maidservants have counted me a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Even fools despise me; and when I gone from them, they spoke against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I love most is turned against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The flesh being consumed. My bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who will grant me that my words may be written? Who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is judgment.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s sake of mine own body.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>
            <p data-verse="19:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>
            <p data-verse="19:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>
