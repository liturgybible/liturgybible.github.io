            <p data-verse="29:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to Ariel, to Ariel the city which David took: year is added to year: the solemnities are at an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I will make a trench about Ariel, and it shall be in sorrow and mourning, and it shall be to me as Ariel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will make a circle round about thee, and will cast up a rampart against thee, and raise up bulwarks to besiege thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thou shalt be brought down, thou shalt speak out of the earth, and thy speech shall be heard out of the ground: and thy voice shall be from the earth like that of the python, and out of the ground thy speech shall mutter.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the multitude of them that fan thee, shall be like small dust: and as ashes passing away, the multitude of them that have prevailed against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it shall be at an instant suddenly. A visitation shall come from the Lord of hosts in thunder, and with earthquake, and with a great noise of whirlwind and tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the multitude of all nations that have fought against Ariel, shall be as the dream of a vision by night, and all that have fought, and besieged and prevailed against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And as he that is hungry dreameth, and eateth, but when he is awake, his soul is empty: and as he that is thirsty dreameth, and drinketh, and after he is awake, is yet faint with thirst, and his soul is empty: so shall be the multitude of all the Gentiles, that have fought against mount Sion.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be astonished, and wander, waver, and stagger: be drunk, and not with wine: stagger, and not with drunkenness.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the Lord hath mingled for you the spirit of a deep sleep, he will shut up your eyes, he will cover your prophets and princes, that see visions.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the vision of all shall be unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which when they shall deliver to one that is learned, they shall say: Read this: and he shall answer: I cannot, for it is sealed.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the book shall be given to one that knoweth no letters, and it shall be said to him: Read: and he shall answer: I know no letters.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord said: Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips glorify me, but their heart is far from me, and they have feared me with the commandment and doctrines of men:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore behold I will proceed to cause an admiration in this people, by a great and wonderful miracle: for wisdom shall perish from their wise men, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Woe to you that are deep of heart, to hide your counsel from the Lord: and their works are in the dark, and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth us?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> This thought of yours is perverse: as if the clay should think against the potter, and the work should say to the maker thereof: Thou madest me not: or the thing framed should say to him that fashioned it: Thou understandest not.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Is it not yet a very little while, and Libanus shall be turned into charmel, and charmel shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and out of darkness and obscurity the eyes of the blind shall see.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For he that did prevail hath failed, the scorner is consumed, and they are all cut off that watched for iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That made men sin by word, and supplanted him that reproved them in the gate, and declined in vain from the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord to the house of Jacob, he that redeemed Abraham: Jacob shall not now be confounded, neither shall his countenance now be ashamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But when he shall see his children, the work of my hands in the midst of him sanctifying my name, and they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall glorify the God of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they that erred in spirit, shall know understanding, and they that murmured, shall learn the law.</p>

            <p data-verse="29:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</p>
