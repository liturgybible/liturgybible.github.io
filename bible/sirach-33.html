            <p data-verse="33:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There shall no evil happen unto him that feareth the Lord; but in temptation even again he will deliver him.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A wise man hateth not the law; but he that is an hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A man of understanding trusteth in the law; and the law is faithful unto him, as an oracle.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard: and bind up instruction, and then make answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheel; and his thoughts are like a rolling axletree.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, he neigheth under every one that sitteth upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Why doth one day excel another, when as all the light of every day in the year is of the sun?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Some of them hath he made high days, and hallowed them, and some of them hath he made ordinary days.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and made their ways diverse.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Some of them hath he blessed and exalted and some of them he sanctified, and set near himself: but some of them hath he cursed and brought low, and turned out of their places.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> As the clay is in the potter’s hand, to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as liketh him best.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Good is set against evil, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So look upon all the works of the most High; and there are two and two, one against another.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I awaked up last of all, as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and tred my winepress like a gatherer of grapes.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Consider that I laboured not for myself only, but for all them that seek learning.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Hear me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Give not thy son and wife, thy brother and friend, power over thee while thou livest, and give not thy goods to another: lest it repent thee, and thou intreat for the same again.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As long as thou livest and hast breath in thee, give not thyself over to any.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For better it is that thy children should seek to thee, than that thou shouldest stand to their courtesy.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In all thy works keep to thyself the preeminence; leave not a stain in thine honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> At the time when thou shalt end thy days, and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work, for a servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest: but if thou let him go idle, he shall seek liberty.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A yoke and a collar do bow the neck: so are tortures and torments for an evil servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Send him to labour, that he be not idle; for idleness teacheth much evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Set him to work, as is fit for him: if he be not obedient, put on more heavy fetters.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But be not excessive toward any; and without discretion do nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> If thou have a servant, let him be unto thee as thyself, because thou hast bought him with a price.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If thou have a servant, entreat him as a brother: for thou hast need of him, as of thine own soul: if thou entreat him evil, and he run from thee, which way wilt thou go to seek him?</p>
