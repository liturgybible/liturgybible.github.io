            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> But they laid hands on him, and held him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> And their witness did not agree.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And they all forsook him, and fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>
