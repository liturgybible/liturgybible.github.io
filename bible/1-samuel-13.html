            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Saul was a child of one year when he began to reign, and he reigned two years over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: and two thousand were with Saul in Machmas, and in mount Bethel: and a thousand with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin, and the rest of the people he sent back every man to their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all Israel heard this report: Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines: and Israel took courage against the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Galgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Philistines also were assembled to fight against Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a multitude of people besides, like the sand on the sea shore for number. And going up they camped in Machmas at the east of Bethaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened, (for the people were distressed,) they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad. And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the people that followed him were greatly afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he waited seven days according to the appointment of Samuel, I and Samuel came not to Galgal, and the people slipt away from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Saul said: Bring me the holocaust, and the peace offerings. And he offered the holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he had made an end of offering the holocaust, behold Samuel came: and Saul went forth to meet him and salute him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Samuel said to him: What hast thou done? Saul answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come according to the days appointed, and the Philistines were gathered together in Machmas,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I said: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord. Forced by necessity, I offered the holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the Lord commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, to meet the people who fought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa in the hill of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people, that were found with him, about six hundred men.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, were in Gabaa of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Machmas.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three companies to plunder. One company went towards the way of Ephra to the land of Sual;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And another went by the way of Beth-horon, and the third turned to the way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had taken this precaution, lest the Hebrews should make them swords or spears.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So all Israel went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his rake.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks, and their axes were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be mended.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when the day of battle was come, there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan, except Saul and Jonathan his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the army of the Philistines went out in order to advance further in Machmas.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</p>
