            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This is the word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a book.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, saith the Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And these are the words that the Lord hath spoken to Israel and to Juda:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of terror : there is fear and no peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ask ye, and see if a man bear children ? why then have I seen every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labour, and all faces are turned yellow?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Alas, for that day is great, neither is there the like to it; and it Is the time of tribulation to Jacob, but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst his bands: and strangers shall no more rule over him:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from a country afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity: and Jacob shall return, and be at rest, and abound with all good things, and there shall be none whom he may fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: for I will utterly consume all the nations, among which I have scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thus saith the Lord: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is very grievous.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up : thou hast no healing medicines.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and will not seek after thee: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with a cruel chastisement: by reason of the multitude of thy iniquities, thy sins are hardened.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is incurable: for the multitude of thy iniquity, and for thy hardened sins I have done these things to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured: and all thy enemies shall be carried into captivity : and they that waste thee shall be wasted, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I will close up thy scar, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord. Because they have called thee, O Sion, an outcast: This is she that hath none to seek after her.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thus saith the Lord: Behold I bring back the captivity of the pavilions of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, and the city shall be built in her place, and the temple shall be found according to the order thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be made few : and I will glorify them, and they shall not be lessened.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And their children shall be as from the beginning, and their assembly be permanent before me : and I will against all that afflict them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince shall come forth from the midst of them : and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his heart to approach to me, saith the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And you shall be my people: and I will be your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Behold the whirlwind of the Lord, his fury going forth, a violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation, till he have executed and performed the thought o his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things.</p>

            <p data-verse="30:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="30:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</p>
            <p data-verse="30:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</p>
            <p data-verse="30:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="30:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</p>
