            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He built also the house of the forest of Libanus, the length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was held up with five and forty pillars. And one row had fifteen pillars,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Set one against another,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars, and over the pillars were square beams in- all things equal.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch: and pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He made also the porch of the throne, wherein is the seat of judgment: and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And in the midst of the porch, was a small house where he sat in judgment, of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without unto the great court.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten cubits or eight cubits:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And above there were costly stones, or equal measure, hewed; and, in like manner, planks of cedar:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the greater court was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one row of planks of cedar, moreover also in the inner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The son of a widow woman of the tribe of Nephtali, whose father was a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast : seven rows of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did he to the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily work in the porch, of four cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And again other chapiters in the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network: and of pomegranates there were two hundred in rows round about the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof Jachin: in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the name thereof Booz.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily work: so the work of the pillars was finished.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He made also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And a graven work under the brim of it compassed it, for ten cubits going about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the north, and three towards the west, and three towards the south, and three towards the east, and the sea was above upon them, and their hinder parts were all hid within.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the laver was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was like the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven: and there were gravings between the joinings.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And between the little crowns and the ledges were lions, and oxen, and cherubims: and in the joinings likewise above: and under the lions and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And every base had four wheels, and axletrees of brass: and at the four sides were undersetters under the laver molten, looking one against another.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the chapiter: and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round, and together it was one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were divers engravings: and the spaces between the pillars were square, not round.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and their axletrees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all east.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the four undersetters that were at every corner of each base, were of the base itself cast and joined together.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And in the top of the base there was a round compass of half a cubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its gravings, and divers sculptures of itself.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass. and in the corners, cherubims, and lions, and palm trees, in likeness of a man standing, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> After this manner he made ten bases, of one casting and measure, and the like graving.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bases, and was of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many lavers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple, and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple over against the east southward.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Hiram made caldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished all the work of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the chapiters of the pillars: and the two networks, to cover the two cords, that were upon the top of the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks: two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the cords of the chapiters, which were upon the tops of the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And the caldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the vessels that Hi- ram made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of fine brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> In the plains of the Jordan did the king cast them in a clay ground, between Socoth and Sartham.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Solomon placed all the vessels: but for exceeding great multitude the brass could not be weighed.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the leaves of proposition should be set:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on the left, over against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like lilies, and the lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And pots, and fleshhooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of most pure gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple were of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the Lord, and brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the house of the Lord.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p>
