            <p data-verse="49:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The remembrance of Josias is like the composition of the perfume that is made by the art of the apothecary: it is sweet as honey in all mouths, and as musick at a banquet of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people, and took away the abominations of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He directed his heart unto the Lord, and in the time of the ungodly he established the worship of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> All, except David and Ezekias and Josias, were defective: for they forsook the law of the most High, even the kings of Juda failed.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore he gave their power unto others, and their glory to a strange nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They burnt the chosen city of the sanctuary, and made the streets desolate, according to the prophecy of Jeremias.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For they entreated him evil, who nevertheless was a prophet, sanctified in his mother’s womb, that he might root out, and afflict, and destroy; and that he might build up also, and plant.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It was Ezekiel who saw the glorious vision, which was shewed him upon the chariot of the cherubims.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of the rain, and directed them that went right.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And of the twelve prophets let the memorial be blessed, and let their bones flourish again out of their place: for they comforted Jacob, and delivered them by assured hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> How shall we magnify Zorobabel? even he was as a signet on the right hand:</p>
            <p data-verse="49:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So was Jesus the son of Josedec: who in their time builded the house, and set up an holy temple to the Lord, which was prepared for everlasting glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And among the elect was Neemias, whose renown is great, who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, and set up the gates and the bars, and raised up our ruins again.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But upon the earth was no man created like Enoch; for he was taken from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Neither was there a young man born like Joseph, a governor of his brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adam above every living thing in creation.</p>
