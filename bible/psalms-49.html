            <p data-verse="49:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear these things, all ye nations: give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men: both rich and poor together.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> My mouth shall speak wisdom: and the meditation of my heart understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on the psaltery.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Why shall I fear in the evil day? the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude of their riches,</p>
            <p data-verse="49:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem: he shall not give to God his ransom,</p>
            <p data-verse="49:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nor the price of the redemption of his soul: and shall labour for ever,</p>
            <p data-verse="49:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> and shall still live unto the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying: the senseless and the fool shall perish together: And they shall leave their riches to strangers:</p>
            <p data-verse="49:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> and their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever. Their dwelling places to all generations: they have called their lands by their names.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them: and afterwards they shall delight in their mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They are laid in hell like sheep: death shall feed upon them. And the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their help shall decay in hell from their glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed: and he will praise thee when thou shalt do well to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He shall go in to the generations of his fathers: and he shall never see light.</p>
            <p data-verse="49:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Man when he was in honour did not understand: he hath been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them.</p>
