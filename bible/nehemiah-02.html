            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him, and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one languishing away before his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceeding great fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I came to the governors of the country beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent wish me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was come, who sought the prosperity of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and returned.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</p>
