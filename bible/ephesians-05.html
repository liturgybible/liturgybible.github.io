            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Proving what is well pleasing to God:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
