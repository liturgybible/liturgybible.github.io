            <p data-verse="78:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> that another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of</p>
            <p data-verse="78:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
            <p data-verse="78:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people?</p>
            <p data-verse="78:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water?</p>
            <p data-verse="78:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: band the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land which he founded for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> And he chose his servant David, and took him from the hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young,</p>
            <p data-verse="78:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

            <p data-verse="78:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
            <p data-verse="78:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
            <p data-verse="78:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
            <p data-verse="78:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="78:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="78:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
            <p data-verse="78:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
            <p data-verse="78:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their  iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
            <p data-verse="78:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
            <p data-verse="78:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their  strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to  this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which  he placed among men;</p>
            <p data-verse="78:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:67"><span class="verse-num">67</span> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:68"><span class="verse-num">68</span> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:69"><span class="verse-num">69</span> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:70"><span class="verse-num">70</span> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
            <p data-verse="78:71"><span class="verse-num">71</span> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="78:72"><span class="verse-num">72</span> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
