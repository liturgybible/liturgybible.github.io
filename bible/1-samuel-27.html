            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David said in his heart: I shall gone day or other fall into the hands of Saul: is it not better for me to flee, and to be saved in the land of the Philistines, that Saul may despair of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will flee then out of his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David arose and went away, both he and the six hundred men that were with him, to Achis the son of Maoch, king of Geth.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his men: every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason Siceleg belongeth to the kings of Juda unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines, was four months.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David and his men went up, and pillaged Gessuri, and Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of the countries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David wasted all the land, and left neither man nor woman alive: and took away the sheep and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achis.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against to day? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David saved neither man nor woman, neither brought he any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So did David, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Achis believed David, saying: He hath done much harm to his people Israel: therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.</p>
