            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He hath set bounds about the waters, till light and darkness come to an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</p>

            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> How hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
