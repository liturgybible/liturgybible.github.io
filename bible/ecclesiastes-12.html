            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the time of affliction come, and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say: They please me not:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars be darkened, and the clouds return after the rain:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall stagger, and the grinders shall be idle in a small number, and they that look through the holes shall be darkened:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they shall shut the doors in the street, when the grinder's voice shall be low, and they shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall grow deaf.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they shall fear high things, and they shall be afraid in the way, the almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall be made fat, and the caper tree shall be destroyed: because man shall go into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall go round about in the street.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Before the silver cord be broken, and the golden fillet shrink back, and the pitcher be crushed at the fountain, and the wheel be broken upon the cistern,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the dust return into its earth, from whence it was, and the spirit return to God, who gave it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, and all things are vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And whereas Ecclesiastes was very wise, he taught the people, and declared the things that he had done: and seeking out, he set forth many parables.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He sought profitable words, and wrote words most right, and full of truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails deeply fastened in, which by the counsel of masters are given from one shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> More than these, my son, require not. Of making many books there is no end: and much study is an affliction of the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let us all hear together the conclusion of the discourse. Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is all man:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And all things that are done, God will bring into judgment for every error, whether it be good or evil.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</p>
