            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Amen, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I and the Father are one.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The Jews then took up stones to stone him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I and my Father are one.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And many believed on him there.</p>
