            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought: for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased from sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That now he may live the rest of his time in the flesh , not after the desires of men, but according to the will of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the time past is sufficient to have fulfilled the will of the Gentiles, for them who have walked in riotousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherein they think it strange, that you run not with them into the same confusion of riotousness, speaking evil of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who shall render account to him, who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to the dead: that they might be judged indeed according to men, in the flesh; but may live according to God, in the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the end of all is at hand. Be prudent therefore, and watch in prayers.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But before all things have a constant mutual charity among yourselves: for charity covereth a multitude of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Using hospitality one towards another, without murmuring,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As every man hath received grace, ministering the same one to another: as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If any man speak, let him speak, as the words of God. If any man minister, let him do it, as of the power, which God administereth: that in all things God may be honoured through Jesus Christ: to whom is glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Dearly beloved, think not strange the burning heat which is to try you, as if some new thing happened to you;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But if you partake of the sufferings of Christ, rejoice that when his glory shall be revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed: for that which is of the honour, glory, and power of God, and that which is his Spirit, resteth upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a railer, or a coveter of other men's things.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the time is, that judgment should begin at the house of God. And if first at us, what shall be the end of them that believe not the gospel of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And if the just man shall scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore let them also that suffer according to the will of God, commend their souls in good deeds to the faithful Creator.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</p>
