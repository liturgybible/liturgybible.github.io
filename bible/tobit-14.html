            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift over- pass thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Give and take, and justify thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that springeth out on a green tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and the worker thereof shall go with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And every excellent work shall be justified: and the worker thereof shall be honoured therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that traceth, and stayeth in her ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her door:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that lodgeth near her house, and fastening a pin in her walls shall set up his tent nigh unto her, where good things shall rest in his lodging for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.</p>
