            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who is not fallen from his hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard, and what should an envious man do with gold?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul, gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in rioting.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and he shall not take pleasure in his goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and this is the reward of his wickedness:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul, drying it up.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own table.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part of a good gift over- pass thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy sorrows and labours?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Give and take, and justify thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no finding food.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that springeth out on a green tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and the worker thereof shall go with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And every excellent work shall be justified: and the worker thereof shall be honoured therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of the all seeing eye of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that traceth, and stayeth in her ways:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her door:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that lodgeth near her house, and fastening a pin in her walls shall set up his tent nigh unto her, where good things shall rest in his lodging for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall lodge under her branches:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> So Tobit made an end of praising God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.</p>
