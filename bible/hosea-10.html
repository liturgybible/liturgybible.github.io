            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Their heart is divided: now they shall perish: he shall break down their idols, he shall destroy their altars.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For now they shall say: We have no king: because we fear not the Lord: and what shall a king do to us?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> You speak words of an unprofitable vision, and you shall make a covenant: and judgment shall spring up as bitterness in the furrows of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The inhabitants of Samaria have worshipped the king of Bethaven: for the people thereof have mourned over it, and the wardens of its temple that rejoiced over it in its glory because it is departed from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For itself also is carried into Assyria, a present to the avenging king: shame shall fall upon Ephraim, and Israel shall be confounded in his own will.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Samaria hath made her king to pass as froth upon the face of the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the high places of the idol, the sin of Israel shall be destroyed: the bur and the thistle shall grow up over their altars: and they shall say to the mountains: Cover us; and to the hills: Fall upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> From the days of Gabaa, Israel hath sinned, there they stood: the battle in Gabaa against the children of iniquity shall not overtake them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> According to my desire I will chastise them: and the nations shall be gathered together against them, when they shall be chastised for their two iniquities.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Ephraim is a heifer taught to love to tread out corn, but I passed over upon the beauty of her neck: I will ride upon Ephraim, Juda shall plough, Jacob shall break the furrows for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Sow for yourselves in justice, and reap in the mouth of mercy, break up your fallow ground: but the time to seek the Lord is, when he shall come that shall teach you justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> You have ploughed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lying: because thou hast trusted in thy ways, in the multitude of thy strong ones.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</p>
