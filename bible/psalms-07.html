            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> and a congregation of people shall surround thee. And for their sakes return thou on high.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is God.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword: he hath bent his bow and made it ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</p>
