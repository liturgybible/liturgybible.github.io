            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A wise son heareth the doctrine of his father: but he that is a scorner, beareth not when he is reproved.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Of the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good things: but the soul of transgressors is wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his soul: but he that hath no guard on his speech shall meet with evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The sluggard willeth and willeth not: but the soul of them that work, shall be made fat.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> One is as it were rich, when he hath nothing: and another is as it were poor, when he hath great riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but he that is poor beareth not reprehension.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The light of the just giveth joy: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Among the proud there are always contentions: but they that do all things with counsel, are ruled by wisdom.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul: desire when it cometh is a tree of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whosoever speaketh ill of any thing, bindeth himself for the time to come: but he that feareth the commandment, shall dwell in peace. Deceitful souls go astray in sins: the just are merciful, and shew mercy.</p>
