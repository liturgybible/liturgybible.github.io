            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them: When you shall be come into the land of your habitation, which I will give you,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust, or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth part of a hin of oil:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of hour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he shall offer the third part of the same measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus shalt thou do</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When you are come into the land which I will give you,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And by him hath commanded you, from the day that he began to command and thenceforward,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their ignorance:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his people:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For he hath contemned the word the Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> The Lord also said to Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them I to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> That when they shall see them, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their Cod.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</p>
