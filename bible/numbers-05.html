            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Command the children of Israel, that they cast out of the camp every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed, or is defiled by the dead:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp, lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the children of Israel did so, and they cast them forth without the camp, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and offended,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They shall confess their sin, and restore the principal itself, and the fifth part over and above, to him against whom they have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if there be no one to receive it, they shall give it to the Lord, and it shall be the priest's, besides the ram that is offered for expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> an the firstfruits also, which the children of Israel offer, belong to the priest:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one, and is delivered into the hands of the priest, it shall be his.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man whose wife shall have gone astray, and contemning her husband,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by witnesses, because she was not found in the adultery:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with false suspicion,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an oblation for her, the tenth part of a measure of barley meal: he shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frank- incense upon it: because it is a sacrifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The priest therefore shall offer it, and set it before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when the woman shall stand before the Lord, he shall uncover her head, and shall, put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance, and the oblation of jealousy: and he himself shall hold the most bitter waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with execration.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband's bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped curses, shall not hurt thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband, and art defiled, and hast lain with another man:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> These curses shall light upon thee: The Lord make thee a curse, and an example for all among his people: may he make thy thigh to rot, and may thy belly swell and burst asunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath heaped the curses,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath drunk them up,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it upon the altar: yet so as first,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear children.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside from her husband, and be defiled,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her iniquity.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:</p>

            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</p>

            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</p>
