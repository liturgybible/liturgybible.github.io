            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There was at that time Jephte the Galaadite, a most valiant man and a warrior, the son of a woman that was a harlot, and his father was Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who after they were grown up, thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of another mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered to him needy men, and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they said to him: Come thou and be our prince, and fight against the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he answered them: Are not you the men that hated me, and cast me out of my father's house, and now you are come to me constrained by necessity?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you against the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall deliver them into my band, shall I be your prince?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They answered him: The Lord who heareth these things, he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the people made him their prince. And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, to say in his name, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me, to waste my land?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he answered them: I Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now therefore restore the same peaceably to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith Jephte: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through the desert to the Red Sea and came into Cades.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the king of Moab, who likewise refused to give him passage. He abode therefore in Cades,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the land of Moab: and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon: and he would not enter the bounds of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But he also despising the words of Israel, suffered him not to pass through his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude, went out against him to Jasa, and made strong opposition.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord delivered him with all his army into the hands of Israel, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite the inhabitant of that country,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So the Lord the God of Israel destroyed the Amorrhite, his people of Israel fighting against him, and wilt thou now possess this land?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth, due to thee by right? But what the Lord our God hath obtained by conquest, shall be our possession:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Unless perhaps thou art better than Balac the son of Sephor king of Moab: or canst shew that he strove against Israel and fought against him,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon, and the villages thereof, and in Aroer, and its villages, and in all the cities near the Jordan, for three hundred years. Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this claim?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou wrongest me by declaring an unjust war against me. The Lord be judge and decide this day between Israel and the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words of Jephte, which he sent him by the messengers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte, and going round Galaad, and Manasses, and Maspha of Galaad, and passing over from thence to the children of Ammon,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He made a vow to the Lord, saying: If thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of my house, and shall meet me when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon, to fight against them: and the Lord delivered them into his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And when Jephte returned into Maspha to his house, his only daughter met him with timbrels and with dances: for he had no other children.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said: Alas! my daughter, thou hast deceived me, and thou thyself art deceived: for I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I can do no other thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord, do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the victory hath been granted to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And she said to her father: Grant me only this which I desire: Let me go, that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may bewail my virginity with my companions.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he answered her: Go. And he sent her away for two months. And when she was gone with her comrades and companions, she mourned her virginity in the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the two months being expired, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man. From thence came a fashion in Israel, and a custom has been kept:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> That from year to year the daughters of Israel assemble together, and lament the daughter of Jephte the Galaadite for four days.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</p>
