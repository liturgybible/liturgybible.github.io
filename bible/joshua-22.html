            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said to them: You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: you have also obeyed me in all things,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He said to them : With much substance and riches, you return to your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of raiment: divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan, in the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain messengers had brought them an account that the children of Ruben, and of Cad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say: To morrow your children will say to our children: What have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion you children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought, it best,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to morrow may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the children of Ruben, and the children of Cad called the altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="22:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD’S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)</p>
            <p data-verse="22:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;</p>
            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.</p>
