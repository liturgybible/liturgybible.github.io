            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came and said to Jonathan: What have I done? what is my iniquity, and what is my sin against thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said to him: God forbid, thou shalt not die: for my father will do nothing great or little, without first telling me: hath then my father hid this word only from me? no, this shall not be.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but one step (as I may say) between me and death.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jonathan said to David: Whatsoever thy soul shall say to me, I will do for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said to Jonathan: Behold to morrow is the new moon, and I according to custom am wont to sit beside the king to eat: let me go then that I may be hid in the field till the evening of the third day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thy father look and inquire for me, thou shalt answer him: David asked me that he might run to Bethlehem his own city: because there are solemn sacrifices there for all his tribe.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If he shall say, It is well: thy servant shall have peace: but if he be angry, know that his malice is come to its height.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Deal mercifully then with thy servant: for thou hast brought me thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee. But if there be any iniquity in me, do thou kill me, and bring me not in to thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jonathan said: Far be this from thee: for if I should certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee, I could do no otherwise than tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David answered Jonathan: Who shall bring me word, if thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Jonathan said to David: Come and let us go out into the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the field,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall discover my father's mind, to morrow or the day after, and there be any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and make it known to thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan and add still more. But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace, and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if I live, thou shalt shew me the kindness of the Lord: but if I die,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for ever, when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David, every one of them from the earth, may he take away Jonathan from his house, and may the Lord require it at the hands of David's enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of David: and the Lord required it at the hands of David's enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jonathan swore again to David, because he loved him: for he loved him as his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and thou wilt be missed:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For thy seat will be empty till after tomorrow. So thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place, where thou must be hid on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain beside the stone, which is called Ezel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as if I were exercising myself at a mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the arrows.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because, there is peace to thee, and there is no evil, as the Lord liveth. But if I shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are beyond thee: go in peace, for the Lord hath sent thee away.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the Lord be between thee and me for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king sat down to eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when the king sat down upon his chair (according to custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place appeared empty.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Saul said nothing that day, for he thought it might have happened to him, that he was not clean, nor purified.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when the second day after the new moon was come, David's place appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday nor to day?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Jonathan answered Saul: He asked leave of me earnestly to go to Bethlehem,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For this cause he came not to the king's table.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him: Thou son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the confusion of thy shameless mother?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jonathan answering Saul his father, said: Why shall he die: what hath he done?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood that it was determined by his father to kill David.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field, according to the appointment with David, and a little boy with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Jonathan cried again after the boy, saying: Make haste speedily, stand not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go, and carry them into the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when the boy was gone, David rose out of his place, which was towards the south, and falling on his face to the ground, adored thrice: and kissing one another, they wept together, but David more.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And David arose, and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</p>
