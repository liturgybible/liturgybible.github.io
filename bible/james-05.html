            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.</p>
