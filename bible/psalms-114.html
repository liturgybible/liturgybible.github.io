            <p data-verse="114:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people:</p>
            <p data-verse="114:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Judea made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like the lambs of the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee: and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?</p>
            <p data-verse="114:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?</p>
            <p data-verse="114:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob:</p>
            <p data-verse="114:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not to us, O Lord, not to us; but to thy name give glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake: lest the gentiles should say: Where is their God?</p>
            <p data-verse="114:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things whatsoever he would.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The idols of the gentiles are silver and gold, the works of the hands of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They have mouths and speak not: they have eyes and see not.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They have ears and hear not: they have noses and smell not.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> They have hands and feel not: they have feet and walk not: neither shall they cry out through their throat.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let them that make them become like unto them: and all such as trust in them.</p>

            <p data-verse="114:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They that fear the Lord hath hoped in the Lord: he is their helper and their protector.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The Lord hath been mindful of us, and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="114:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.</p>
