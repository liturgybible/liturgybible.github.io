            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:</p>

            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</p>
