            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when the battle is now at hand, the priest shall stand before the army, and shall speak to the people in this manner:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Hear, O Israel, you join battle this day against your enemies, let not your heart be dismayed, be not afraid, do not give back, fear ye them not:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Because the Lord your God is in the midst of you, and will fight for you against your enemies, to deliver you from danger.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the captains shall proclaim through every band in the hearing of the army: What man is there, that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> What man is there, that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not as yet made it to be common, whereof all men may eat? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man execute his office.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> What man is there, that hath espoused a wife, and not taken her? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man take her.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> After these things are declared they shall add the rest, and shall speak to the people: What man is there that is fearful, and faint hearted? let him go, and return to his house, lest he make the hearts of his brethren to fear, as he himself is possessed with fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when the captains of the army shall hold their peace, and have made an end of speaking, every man shall prepare their bands to fight.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If at any time thou come to fight against a city, thou shalt first offer it peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If they receive it, and open the gates to thee, all the people that are therein, shall be saved, and shall serve thee paying tribute.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But if they will not make peace, and shall begin war against thee, thou shalt besiege it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy bands, thou shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex, with the edge of the sword,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Excepting women and children, cattle and other things, that are in the city. And thou shalt divide all the prey to the army, and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the Lord thy God shall give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great distance from thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt receive in possession.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt suffer none at all to live:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword, to wit, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they have done to their gods: and you should sin against the Lord your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath compassed it with bulwarks to take it, thou shalt not cut down the trees that may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country round about with axes: for it is a tree, and not a man, neither can it increase the number of them that fight against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take the city, which fighteth against thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man’s life ) to employ them in the siege:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p>
