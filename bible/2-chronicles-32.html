            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, and this truth, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came and entered into Juda, and besieged the fenced cities, desiring to take them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Ezechias saw that Sennacherib was come, and that the whole force of the war was turning against Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He took counsel with the princes, and the most valiant men, to stop up the heads of the springs, that were without the city: and as they were all of this mind,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He gathered together a very great multitude, and they stopped up all the springs, and the brook, that ran through the midst of the land, saying: Lest the kings of the Assyrians should come, and And abundance of water.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He built up also with great diligence all the wall that had been broken down, and built towers upon it, and another wall without: and he repaired Mello in the city of David, and made all sorts of arms and shields:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he appointed captains of the soldiers of the army: and he called them all together in the street of the gate of the city, and spoke to their heart, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behave like men, and take courage: be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of the Assyrians, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there are many more with us than with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For with him is an arm of flesh: with us the Lord our God, who is our helper, and fighteth for us. And the people were encouraged with these words of Ezechias king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> After this, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians sent his servants to Jerusalem, (for he with all his army was besieging Lachis,) to Ezechias king of Juda, and to all the people that were in the city, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus saith Sennacherib king of the Assyrians: In whom do you trust, that you sit still besieged in Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Doth not Ezechias deceive you, to give you up to die by hunger and thirst, affirming that the Lord your God shall deliver you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Is it not this same Ezechias, that hath destroyed his high places, and his altars, and commanded Juda and Jerusalem, saying: You shall worship before one altar, and upon it you shall burn incense?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of the lands? have the gods of any nations and lands been able to deliver their country out of my hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Who is there among all the gods of the nations, which my fathers have destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of this hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore let not Ezechias deceive you, nor delude you with a vain persuasion, and do not believe him. For if no god of all the nations and kingdoms, could deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers, consequently neither shall your God be able to deliver you out of my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And many other things did his servants speak against the Lord God, and against Ezechias his servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He wrote also letters full of blasphemy against the Lord the God of Israel, and he spoke against him: As the gods of other nations could not deliver their people out of my hand, so neither can the God of Ezechias deliver his people out of this hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Moreover he cried out with a loud voice, in the Jews' tongue, to the people that sat on the walls of Jerusalem, that he might frighten them, and take the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, the works of the hands of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Ezechias the king, and Isaias the prophet the son of Amos, prayed against this blasphemy, and cried out to heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord sent an angel who cut off all the stout men and the warriors, and the captains of the army of the king of the Assyrians: and he returned with disgrace into his own country. And when he was come into the house of his god, his sons that came out of his bowels, slew him with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Lord saved Ezechias and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of the hand of Sennacherib king of the Assyrians, and out of the hand of all, and gave them treasures on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Many also brought victims, and sacrifices to the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to Ezechias king of Juda: and he was magnified thenceforth in the sight of all nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> In those days Ezechias was sick even to death, and he prayed to the Lord: and he heard him, and gave him a sign.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But he did not render again according to the benefits which he had received, for his heart was lifted up: and wrath was enkindled against him, and against Juda and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he humbled himself afterwards, because his heart had been lifted up, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Ezechias.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Ezechias was rich, and very glorious, and he gathered himself great treasures of silver and of gold, and of precious stones, of spices, and of arms, of all kinds, and of vessels of great price.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Storehouses also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and stalls for all beasts, and folds for cattle.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he built himself cities: for he had docks of sheep, and herds without number, for the Lord had given him very much substance.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> This same Ezechias was, he that stopped the upper source of the waters of Gihon, and turned them away underneath toward the west of the city of David : in ail his works he did prosperously what he would.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But yet in the embassy of the princes of Babylon, that were sent to him, to inquire of the wonder that had happened upon the earth, God left him that he might be tempted, and all things might be made known that were in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ezechias, and of his mercies are written in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Ezechias slept with his fathers, m and they buried him above the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem celebrated his funeral: and Manasses his son reigned in his stead.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</p>
