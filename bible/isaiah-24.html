            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest: and as with the servant, so with his master: as with the handmaid, so with her mistress: as with the buyer, so with the seller: as with the lender, so with the borrower: as with him that calleth for his money, so with him that oweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With desolation shall the earth be laid waste, and it shall be utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The earth mourned, and faded away, and is weakened: the world faded away, the height of the people of the earth is weakened.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the earth is infected by the in- habitants thereof: because they have transgressed the laws, they have changed the ordinance, they have broken the everlasting covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore shall a curse devour the earth, and the inhabitants thereof shall sin: and therefore they that dwell therein shall be mad, and few men shall be left.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The mirth of timbrels hath ceased, the noise of them that rejoice is ended, the melody of the harp is silent.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They shall not drink wine with a song: the drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The city of vanity is broken down, every house is shut up, no man cometh in.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There shall be a crying for wine in the streets: all mirth is forsaken: the joy of the earth is gone away.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> With breaking shall the earth be broken, with crushing shall the earth be crushed, with trembling shall the earth be moved.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it shall come to pass, that in that day the Lord shall visit upon the host of heaven on high, and upon the kings of the earth, on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they shall be gathered together as in the gathering of one bundle into the pit, and they shall be shut up there in prison: and after many days they shall be visited.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> fend the moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, and shall be glorified in the sight of his ancients.</p>
