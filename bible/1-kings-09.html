            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all that he desired, and was pleased to do,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That the Lord appeared to him the second time, as he had appeared to him in Gabaon.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Lord said to him: I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, which thou hast made before me: I have sanctified this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there always.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if thou wilt walk before me, as thy father walked, in simplicity of heart, and in uprightness: and wilt do all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my ordinances and my judgments,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I will establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever, as I promised David thy father, saying: There shall not fail a man of thy race upon the throne of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But if you and your children revolting shall turn away from following me, and will not keep my commandments, and my ceremonies, which I have set before you, but will go and worship strange gods, and adore them:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I will take away Israel from the face of the land which I have given them; and the temple which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb, and a byword among all people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And this house shall be made an example of: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and followed strange gods, and adored them, and worshipped them: therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when twenty years were ended after Solomon had built the two houses, that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> 11(Hiram the king of Tyre furnishing Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and gold according to all he had need of.) then Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Hiram came out of Tyre, to see the towns which Solomon had given him, and they pleased him not,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said: Are these the cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them the land of Chabul, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Hiram sent to king Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> This is the sum of the expenses, which king Solomon offered to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Mello, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Heser, and Mageddo, and Gazer.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Pharao the king of Egypt came up and took Gazer, and burnt it with fire: and slew the Chanaanite that dwelt in the city, and gave it for a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Solomon built: Gazer, and Beth-horon the nether,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Baalath, and Palmira in the land of the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And all the towns that belonged to himself, and were not walled, he fortified, the cities also of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and whatsoever he had a mind to build in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> All the people that were left of the Amorrhites, and Hethites, and Pherezites, and Hevites, and Jebusites, that are not of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Their children, that were left in the land, to wit, such as the children of Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But of the children of Israel Solomon made not any to be bondmen, but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and captains, and overseers of the chariots and horses.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there were five hundred and fifty chief officers set over all the works of Solomon, and they had people under them, and had charge over the appointed works.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the daughter of Pharao came up out of the city of David to her house, which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Mello.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Solomon also offered three times every year holocausts, and victims of peace offerings upon the altar which he had built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord: and the temple was finished.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And king Solomon made a fleet in Asiongaber, which is by Ailath on the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Hiram sent his servants in the fleet, sailors that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they came to Ophir, and they brought from thence to king Solomon four hundred and twenty talents of gold.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</p>

            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>

            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> ( Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>
