            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Who will give water to my head, and a fountain of tears to my eyes? and I will weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who will give me in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men, and I will leave my people, and depart from them? because they are all adulterers, an assembly of transgressors.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they have bent their tongue, as a bow, for lies, and not for truth: they have strengthened themselves upon the earth, for they have proceeded from evil to evil, and me they have not known, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let every man take heed of his neighbor, and let his not trust in any brother of his: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth: for they have taught their tongue to speak lies: they have laboured to commit iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit: Through deceit they have refused to know me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will melt, and try them: for what else shall I do before the daughter of my people?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their tongue is a piercing arrow, it hath spoken deceit: with his mouth one speaketh peace with his friend, and secretly he lieth in wait for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul be revenged on such a nation?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the mountains I will take up weeping and lamentation, and for the beautiful places of the desert, mourning: because they are burnt up, for that there is not a man that passeth through them: and they have not heard the voice of the owner: from the fowl of the air to the beasts they are gone away and departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps of sand, and dens of dragons: and I will make the cities of Juda desolate, for want of an inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Who is the wise man, that may understand this, and to whom the word of the mouth of the Lord may come that he may declare this, why the land hath perished, and is burnt up like a wilderness, which none passeth through?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken my law, which I gave them, and have not heard my voice, and have not walked in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But they have gone after the perverseness of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I will scatter them among the nations, which they and their fathers have not known: and I will send the sword after them till they be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, and let them come: and send to them that are wise women, and let them make haste:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us: let our eyes shed tears, and our eyelids run down with waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion: How are we wasted and greatly confounded? because we have left the land, because our dwellings are cast down.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Hear therefore, ye women, the word of the Lord: and let your ears receive the word of his mouth: and teach your daughters wailing: and every one her neighbor mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For death is come up through our windows, it is entered into our houses to destroy the children from without, the young men from the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Even the carcass of man shall fall as dung upon the face of the country, and as grass behind the back of the mower, and there is none to gather it.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thus saith the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength, and let not the rich man glory in his riches:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and justice in the earth: for these things please me, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit upon every one that hath the foreskin circumcised.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Upon Egypt, and upon Juda, and upon Edom, and upon the children of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon all that have their hair polled round, that dwell in the desert: for all the nations are uncircumcised in the flesh, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.</p>
