            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:59"><span class="verse-num">59</span> Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:60"><span class="verse-num">60</span> Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:61"><span class="verse-num">61</span> Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:62"><span class="verse-num">62</span> Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:63"><span class="verse-num">63</span> Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:64"><span class="verse-num">64</span> Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:65"><span class="verse-num">65</span> Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:66"><span class="verse-num">66</span> Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</p>
