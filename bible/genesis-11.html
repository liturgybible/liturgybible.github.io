            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us make brick, and bake them of stones, and slime instead of mortar.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven: and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam were building.</p>
