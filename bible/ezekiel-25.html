            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon, and thou shalt prophesy of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt say to the children of Ammon: Hear ye the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast said: Ha, ha, upon my sanctuary, because it was profaned: and upon the land of Israel, because it was laid waste: and upon the house of Juda, because they are led into captivity:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore will I deliver thee to the men of the east for an inheritance, and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee, and shall set up their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits: and they shall drink thy milk.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast clapped thy hands and stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against the land of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore behold I: will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee to be the spoil of nations, and will cut thee off from among the people, and destroy thee out of the lands, and break thee in pieces: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir have said: Behold the house of Juda is like all other nations:</p>

            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my wrath, and my fury: and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Because the Philistines have taken vengeance, and have revenged themselves with all their mind, destroying and satisfying old enmities :</p>
