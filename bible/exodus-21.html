            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> These are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve thee: in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With what raiment he came in, with the like let him go out: if having a wife, his wife also shall go out with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But if his master gave him a wife, and she hath borne sons and daughters: the woman and her children shall be her master's: but he himself shall go out with his raiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And if the servant shall say: I love my master and my wife and children, I will not go out free:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> His master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall be set to the door and the posts, and he shall bore his ear through with an awl: and he shall be his servant for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If any man sell his daughter to be a servant, she shall not go out as bondwomen are wont to go out.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If she displease the eyes of her master to whom she was delivered, he shall let her go: but he shall have no power to sell her to a foreign nation, if he despise her.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if he have betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And if he take another wife for him, he shall provide her a marriage, and raiment, neither shall he refuse the price of her chastity.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If he do not these three things, she shall go out free without money.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that striketh a man with a will to kill him, shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But he that did not lie in wait for him, but God delivered him into his hands: I will appoint thee a place to which he must flee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If a man kill his neighbour on set purpose and by lying in wait for him: thou shalt take him away from my altar, that he may die.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that striketh his father or mother, shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that shall steal a man, and sell him, being convicted of guilt, shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He that curseth his father, or mother, shall die the death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If men quarrel, and the one strike his neighbour with a stone or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff, he that struck him shall be quit, yet so that he make restitution for his work, and for his expenses upon the physicians.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He that striketh his bondman or bondwoman with a rod, and they die under his hands, shall be guilty of the crime.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But if the party remain alive a day or two, he shall not be subject to the punishment, because it is his money.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If men quarrel, and one strike a woman with child, and she miscarry indeed, but live herself: he shall be answerable for so much damage as the woman's husband shall require, and as arbiters shall award.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But if her death ensue thereupon, he shall render life for life.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If any man strike the eye of his manservant or maidservant, and leave them but one eye, he shall let them go free for the eye which he put out.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Also if he strike out a tooth of his manservant or maidservant, he shall in like manner make them free.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> If an ox gore a man or a woman, and they die, he shall be stoned: and his flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall be quit.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But if the ox was wont to push with his horn yesterday and the day before, and they warned his master, and he did not shut him up, and he shall kill a man or a woman: then the ox shall be stoned, an his owner also shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And if they set a price upon him, he shall give for his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If he have gored a son, or a daughter, he shall fall under the like sentence.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If he assault a bondman or a bond woman, he shall give thirty sicles of silver to their master, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> If a man open a pit, and dig one, and cover it not, and an ox or an ass fall into it,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> The owner of the pit shall pay the price of the beasts: and that which is dead shall be his own.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> If one man's ox gore another man's ox, and he die: they shall sell the live ox, and shall divide the price, and the carcass of that which died they shall part between them:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But if he knew that his ox was wont to push yesterday and the day before, and his master did not keep him in: he shall pay ox for ox, and shall take the whole carcass.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,</p>

            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.</p>
