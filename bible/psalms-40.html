            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear : and they shall hope in the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God : and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require :</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> that I should do thy will : O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips : O Lord, thou knowest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I have not hid thy justice within my heart : I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me : thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head : and my heart hath forsaken me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, look down, O Lord, to help me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me : 'T is well, 't is well.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say always : The Lord be magnified.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But I am a beggar and poor : the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector : O my God, be not slack.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which  thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</p>
