            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling to him the disciples, and exhorting them, took his leave, and set forward to go into Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he had gone over those parts, and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Where, when he had spent three months, the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria; so he took a resolution to return through Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there accompanied him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus, of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> These going before, stayed for us at Troas.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the Azymes, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, being to depart on the morrow: and he continued his speech until midnight.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And there were a great number of lamps in the upper chamber where we were assembled.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting on the window, being oppressed with a deep sleep, (as Paul was long preaching,) by occasion of his sleep fell from the third loft down, and was taken up dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To whom, when Paul had gone down, he laid himself upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his soul is in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then going up, and breaking bread and tasting, and having talked a long time to them, until daylight, so he departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we, going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being there to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, himself purposing to travel by land.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And sailing thence, the day following we came over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos; and the day following we came to Miletus.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, lest he should be stayed any time in Asia. For he hasted, if it were possible for him, to keep the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the ancients of the church.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they were come to him, and were together, he said to them: You know from the first day that I came into Asia, in what manner I have been with you, for all the time,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears, and temptations which befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to you, but have preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Testifying both to Jews and Gentiles penance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And now, behold, being bound in the spirit, I go to Jerusalem: not knowing the things which shall befall me there:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Save that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to me, saying: That bands and afflictions wait for me at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But I fear none of these things, neither do I count my life more precious than myself, so that I may consummate my course and the ministry of the word which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now behold, I know that all you, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For I have not spared to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops, to rule the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> I know that, after my departure, ravening wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And of your own selves shall arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore watch, keeping in memory, that for three years I ceased not, with tears to admonish every one of you night and day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, who is able to build up, and to give an inheritance among all the sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I have not coveted any man's silver, gold, or apparel, as</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> You yourselves know: for such things as were needful for me and them that are with me, these hands have furnished.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the word of the Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give, rather than to receive.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when he had said these things, kneeling down, he prayed with them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And there was much weeping among them all; and falling on the neck of Paul, they kissed him,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Being grieved most of all for the word which he had said, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,</p>

            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</p>
