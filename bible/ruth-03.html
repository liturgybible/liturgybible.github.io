            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After she was returned to her mother in law, Noemi said to her: My daughter, I will seek rest for thee, and will provide that it may be well with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This Booz, with whose maids thou wast joined in the field, is our near kinsman, and behold this night he winnoweth barley in the threshingfloor.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wash thyself therefore and anoint thee, and put on thy best garments, and go down to the barnfloor: but let not the man see thee, till he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt go in, and lift up the clothes wherewith he is covered towards his feet, and shalt lay thyself down there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> She answered: Whatsoever thou shalt command, I will do.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And she went down to the barnfloor, and did all that her mother in law had bid her.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Booz had eaten, and drunk, and was merry, he went to sleep by the heap of sheaves, and she came softly and uncovering his feet, laid herself down.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And behold, when it was now midnight the man was afraid, and troubled: and he saw a woman lying at his feet,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to her: Who art thou? And she answered: I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread thy coverlet over thy servant, for thou art a near kinsman.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said: Blessed art thou of the Lord, my daughter, and thy latter kindness has surpassed the former: because thou hast not followed young men either poor or rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Fear not therefore, but whatsoever thou shalt say to me I will do to thee. For all the people that dwell within the gates of my city, know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Neither do I deny myself to be near of kin, but there is another nearer than I.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Rest thou this night: and when morning is come, if he will take thee by the right of kindred, all is well: but if he will not, I will undoubtedly take thee, as the Lord liveth: sleep till the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So she slept at his feet till the night was going off. And she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: Beware lest any man know that thou camest hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And again he said: Spread thy mantle, wherewith thou art covered, and hold it with both hands. And when she spread it and held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it upon her. And she carried it and went into the city,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And came to her mother in law; who said to her: What hast thou done, daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And she said: Behold he hath given me six measures of barley: for he said: I will not have thee return empty to thy mother in law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Noemi said: Wait my daughter, till we see what end the thing will have. For the man will not rest until he have accomplished what he hath said.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</p>
