            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we were building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he scoffed at the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are burnt?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said : Let them build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a land of captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy builders.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed, that they were exceedingly angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall day and night against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to build the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand, till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence they came to us,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I set the people in the place behind the wall round about in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your wives, and your houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight, with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens, and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the other he held a sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For every one of the builders was girded with a sword about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we are separated on the wall one far from another:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars appear.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> At that time also I said to the people: Let every one with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take our turns in the night, and by day, to work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man stripped himself when he was to be washed.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</p>
