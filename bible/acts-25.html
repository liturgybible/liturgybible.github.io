            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews, went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Requesting favour against him, that he would command him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would very shortly depart thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, go down with me, and accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And having tarried among them no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat in the judgment seat; and commanded Paul to be brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were come down from Jerusalem, objecting many and grievous causes, which they could not prove;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended in any thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver me to them: I appeal to Caesar.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou go.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to salute Festus.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the king of Paul, saying: A certain man was left prisoner by Felix.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests, and the ancients of the Jews, came unto me, desiring condemnation against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To whom I answered: It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have liberty to make his answer, to clear himself of the things laid to his charge.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> When therefore they were come hither, without any delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of things which I thought ill of:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man, myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp, and had entered into the hall of audience, with the tribunes, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment, Paul was brought forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Festus saith: King Agrippa, and all ye men who are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting and crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. For which cause I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that examination being made, I may have what to write.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the things laid to his charge.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</p>
