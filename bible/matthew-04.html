            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Jesus was led by the spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the tempter coming said to him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who answered and said: It is written, Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the devil took him up into the holy city, and set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And said to him: If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written: That he hath given his angels charge over thee, and in their hands shall they bear thee up, lest perhaps thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Jesus said to him: It is written again: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Again the devil took him up into a very high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And said to him: All these will I give thee, if falling down thou wilt adore me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Jesus saith to him: Begone, Satan: for it is written, The Lord thy God shalt thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then the devil left him; and behold angels came and ministered to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Jesus had heard that John was delivered up, he retired into Galilee:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And leaving the city Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capharnaum on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That it might be fulfilled which was said by Isaias the prophet:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The people that sat in darkness, hath seen great light: and to them that sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishers).</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he saith to them: Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they immediately leaving their nets, followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they forthwith left their nets and father, and followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom: and healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity, among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And his fame went throughout all Syria, and they presented to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and such as were possessed by devils, and lunatics, and those that had palsy, and he cured them:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And much people followed him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p>
