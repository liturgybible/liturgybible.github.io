            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the dock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of and of Zelpha his father's wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, end stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's docks,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the docks.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him :</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, end said:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed :</p>
            <p data-verse="37:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And alibis children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;</p>
            <p data-verse="37:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s coat or no.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.</p>
