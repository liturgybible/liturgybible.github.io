            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the wicked is trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: he that followeth justice is beloved by him.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house: but he that hateth bribes shall live. By mercy and faith sins are purged away: and by the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The mind of the just studieth obedience: the mouth of the wicked over floweth with evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The Lord is far from the wicked: and he will hear the prayers of the just.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name maketh the bones fat.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The ear that heareth the reproofs of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He that rejecteth instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof possesseth understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wisdom: and humility goeth before glory.</p>
