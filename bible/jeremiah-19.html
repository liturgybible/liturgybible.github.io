            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt proclaim the words that I shall tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O ye kings of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring an affliction upon this place: so that whoever shall hear it, his ears shall tingle:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this place: and have sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom neither they nor their fathers knew, nor the kings of Juda: and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they have built the high places of Baalim, to burn their children with fire for a holocaust to Baalim: which I did not command, nor speak of, neither did it once come into my mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of Ennom, but the valley of slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will defeat the counsel of Juda and of Jerusalem in this place: and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will make this city an astonishent, and a hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters: and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives shall straiten them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that shall go with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: even so will I break this people, and this city, as the potter's vessel is broken, which cannot be made whole again: and they shall be buried in Topheth, because there is no other place to bury in.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thus will I do to this place, saith the Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as Topheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of Juda shall be unclean as the place of Topheth: all the houses upon whose roots they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings to strange gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Jeremias came from Topheth, whither the Lord had sent him to prophecy, and he stood in the court of the house of the Lord, and said to all people:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof all the evils that I have spoken against it: because they have hardened their necks, and they might not hear my words.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:</p>
