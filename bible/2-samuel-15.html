            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now after these things Absalom made himself chariots, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the gate, and when any man had business to come to the king's judgment, Absalom called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou? He answered, and said: Thy servant is of such a tribe of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Absalom answered him: Thy words seem to me good and just. But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee. And Absalom said:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O that they would make me judge over the land, that all that have business might come to me, that I might do them justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to be heard by the king, and he enticed the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And after forty years, Absalom said to king David: Let me go, and pay my vows which I have vowed to the Lord in Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For thy servant made avow, when he was in Gessur of Syria, saying: If the Lord shall bring me again into Jerusalem I will offer sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And king David said to him: Go in peace. And he arose, and went to Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel, saying: As soon as you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye: Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now there went with Absalom two hundred men out of Jerusalem that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and knowing nothing of the design.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city Gilo. And while he was offering sacrifices, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running together increased with Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And there came a messenger to David, saying: All Israel with their whole heart followeth Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said to his servants, that were with him in Jerusalem: Arise and let us flee: for we shall not escape else from the face of Absalom: make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king's servants said to him: Whatsoever our lord the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the king went forth, and all his household on foot: and the king left ten women his concubines to keep the house:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood afar off from the house:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors, six hundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the king said to Ethai the Gethite: Why comest thou with us? return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come out of thy own place.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go forth with us? but I shall go whither I am going: return thou, and take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee mercy, and truth, because thou hast shewn grace and fidelity.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ethai answered the king, saying: As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth: in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David said to Ethai: Come, and pass over. And Ethai the Gethite passed, and all the men that were with him, and the rest of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself went over the brook Cedron, and all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Sadoc the priest also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God: and Abiathar went up, till all the people that was come out of the city had done passing.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the king said to Sadoc: Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he will bring me again, and he will shew me it, and his tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But if he shall say to me: Thou pleasest me not: I am ready, let him do that which is good before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the king said to Sadoc the priest: O seer, return into the city in peace: and let Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the wilderness, till there come word from you to certify me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So Sadoc and Abiathar carried back the ark of God into Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, going up and weeping, walking barefoot, and with his head covered, and all the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered weeping.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And it was told David that Achitophel also was in the conspiracy with Absalom, and David said: Infatuate, O Lord, I beseech thee, the counsel of Achitophel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when David was come to the top of the mountain, where he was about to adore the Lord, behold Chusai the Arachite, came to meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And David said to him: If thou come with me, thou wilt be a burden to me:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to Absalom: I am thy servant, O king: as I have been thy father's servant, so I will be thy servant: thou shalt defeat the counsel of Achitophel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests: and what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And there are with them their two sons Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar: and you shall send by them to me every thing that you shall hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then Chusai the friend of David went into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p>
