            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And thou Esdras according to the wisdom of thy God, which is in thy hand, appoint judges and magistrates, that may judge all the people, that is beyond the river, that is, for them who know the law of thy God, yea and the ignorant teach ye freely.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king diligently, judgment shall be executed upon him, either unto death, or unto banishment, or to the confiscation of goods, or at least to prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Blessed be the Lord the God of our fathers, who hath put this in the king's heart, to glorify the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem,</p>
