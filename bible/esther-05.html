            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's hall: now he sat upon his throne in the hall of the palace, over against the door of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when he saw Esther the queen standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand: and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said to her: What wilt then, queen Esther? what is thy request? if thou shouldst even ask one half of the kingdom, it shall be given to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But she answered: If it please the king. I beseech thee to come to me this day, and Aman with thee to the banquet which I have prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the king said forthwith: Call ye Aman quickly, that he may obey Esther's will. So the king and Aman came to the banquet which the queen had prepared for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king said to her, after he had drunk wine plentifully: What dost thou desire should be given thee? and for what thing askest thou? although thou shouldst ask the half of my kingdom, thou shalt have it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Esther answered: My petition and request is this:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If I have found favour in the king's sight, and if it please the king to give me what I ask, and to fulfil my petition: let the king and Aman come to the banquet which I have prepared them, and to morrow I will open my mind to the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares his wife:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And after this he said: Queen Esther also hath invited no other to the banquet with the king, but me: and with her I am also to dine to morrow with the king:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai the Jew sitting before the king's gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Zares his wife, and the rest of his friends answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.</p>
