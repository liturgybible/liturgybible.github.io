            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon: for he heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram had always been David's friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou knowest the will of David my father, and that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars that were round about him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But now the Lord my God hath given me rest round about: and there is no adversary nor evil occurrence.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore I purpose to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spoke to David my father, saying: my son, whom I will set upon the throne in thy piece, he shall build a house to my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Give orders therefore that thy servants cut me down cedar trees out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask, for thou knowest how there is not among my people a man that has skill to hew wood like to the Sidonians.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given to David a very wise son over this numerous people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have heard all thou hast desired of me: and I will do all thy desire concerning cedar trees, and fir trees.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: and I will put them together in floats in the sea, and convey them to the place, which thou shalt signify to me; and will land them there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt allow me necessaries, to furnish food for my household.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees, and fir trees, according to all his desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Solomon allowed Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat, for provision for his house, and twenty measures of the purest oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram every year.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a league together.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And king Solomon chose workmen cut of all Israel, and the levy was of thirty thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand every month by turns, so that two months they were at home: and Adoniram was over this levy.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Solomon had seventy thousand to carry burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountain:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Besides the overseers who were over every work, in number three thousand, and three hundred that ruled over the people, and them that did the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king commanded, that they should bring great stones, costly stones, for the foundation of the temple, and should square them:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the masons of Solomon, and the masons of Hiram hewed them: and the Giblians prepared timber and stones to build the house.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</p>
