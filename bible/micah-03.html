            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You that hate good, and love evil: that violently pluck off their skins from them, and their flesh from their bones?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin from off them: and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of the pot.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them: and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved wickedly in their devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to you instead of divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be darkened over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces, because there is no answer of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord, with judgment, and power: to declare unto Jacob his wickedness, and to Israel his sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel: you that abhor judgment, and pervert all that is right.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Her princes have judged for bribes, and her priests have taught for hire, and her prophets divined for money: and they leaned upon the Lord, saying: Is not the Lord in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore, because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain of the temple as the high places of the forests.</p>
