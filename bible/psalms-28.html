            <p data-verse="28:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee; when I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers of iniquity destroy me not: Who speak peace with their neighbour, but evils are in their hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands give thou to them: render to them their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the operations of his hands: thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build them up.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my supplication.</p>

            <p data-verse="28:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord is the strength of his people, and the protector of the salvation of his anointed.</p>
