            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and carried it from the Stone of help into Azotus.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the temple of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the Azotians arose early the next day, behold Dagon lay upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord: and they took Dagon, and set him again in his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the next day again, when they rose in the morning, they found Dagon lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord: and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And only the stump of Dagon remained in its place. For this cause neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that go into the temple tread on the threshold of Dagon in Azotus unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he destroyed them, and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with emerods. And in the villages and fields in the midst of that country, there came forth a multitude of mice, and there was the confusion of a great mortality in the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the men of Azotus seeing this kind of plague, said: The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us: for his hand is heavy upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said: What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And the Gethrites answered: Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And while they were carrying it about, the band of the Lord came upon every city with an exceeding great slaughter: and he smote the men of every city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. And the Gethrites consulted together, and made themselves seats of skins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore they sent the ark of God into Accaron. And when the ark of God was come into Accaron, the Accaronites cried out, saying: They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines: and they said: Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return into its own place, and not kill us and our people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For there was the fear of death in every city, and the hand of God was exceeding heavy. The men also that did not die, were afflicted with the emerods: and the cry of every city went up to heaven.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.</p>
