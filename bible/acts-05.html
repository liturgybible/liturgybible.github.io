            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his wife, sold a piece of land,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land, his wife being privy thereunto: and bringing a certain part of it, laid it at the feet of the apostles.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Peter said: Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost, and by fraud keep part of the price of the land?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And there came great fear upon all that heard it.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the young men rising up, removed him, and carrying him out, buried him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Peter said to her: Tell me, woman, whether you sold the land for so much? And she said: Yea, for so much.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Peter said unto her: Why have you agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry thee out.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Immediately she fell down before his feet, and gave up the ghost. And the young men coming in, found her dead: and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there came great fear upon the whole church, and upon all that heard these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them; but the people magnified them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the multitude of men and women who believed in the Lord, was more increased:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that when Peter came, his shadow at the least, might overshadow any of them, and they might be delivered from their infirmities.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude out of the neighboring cities, bringing sick persons, and such as were troubled with unclean spirits; who were all healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then the high prist rising up, and all they that were with him, (which is the heresy of the Sadducees,) were filled with envy.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But an angel of the Lord by night opening the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Go, and standing speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who having heard this, early in the morning, entered into the temple, and taught. And the high priest coming, and they that were with him, called together the council, and all the ancients of the children of Israel; and they sent to the prison to have them brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But when the ministers came, and opening the prison, found them not there, they returned and told,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Saying: The prison indeed we found shut with all diligence, and the keepers standing before the doors; but opening it, we found no man within.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now when the officer of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them, what would come to pass.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But one came and told them: Behold, the men whom you put in prison are in the temple standing, and teaching the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then went the officer with the ministers, and brought them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Saying: Commanding we commanded you, that you should not teach in this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and you have a mind to bring the blood of this man upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But Peter and the apostles answering, said: We ought to obey God, rather than men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom you put to death, hanging him upon a tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to all that obey him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> When they had heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they thought to put them to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a little while.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all that believed him were scattered, and brought to nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as consented to him, were dispersed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And now, therefore, I say to you, refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this council or this work be of men, it will come to nought;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God. And they consented to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in the name of Jesus; and they dismissed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from house to house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>
            <p data-verse="5:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>
