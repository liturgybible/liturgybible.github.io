            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the dower of Libanus fadeth away.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end of the place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Thus saith the LORD: Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</p>
