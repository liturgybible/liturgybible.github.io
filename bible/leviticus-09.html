            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the eighth day was come, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the ancients of Israel, and said to Aaron:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Take of the herd a calf for sin, and a ram for a holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And to the children of Israel thou shalt say: Take ye a he goat for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year old, and without blemish for a holocaust,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings: and immolate them before the Lord, offering for the sacrifice of every one of them flour tempered with oil; for to day the Lord will appear to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They brought therefore all things that Moses had commanded before the door of the tabernacle: where when all the multitude stood,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath commanded: do it, and his glory will appear to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to Aaron: Approach to the altar, and offer sacrifice for thy sin: offer the holocaust, and pray for thyself and for the people: and when thou hast slain the people's victim, pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated the calf for his sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his sons brought him the blood of it: and he dipped his finger therein, and touched the horns of the altar, and poured the rest at the foot thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He immolated also the victim of holocaust: and his sons brought him the blood thereof, which he poured round about on the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the victim being cut into pieces, they brought to him the head and all the members, all which he burnt with fire upon the altar,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Having first washed the entrails and the feet with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then offering for the sin of the people, he slew the he goat: and expiating the altar,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He offered the holocaust:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Adding in the sacrifice the libations, which are offered withal, and burning them upon the altar, besides the ceremonies of the morning holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He immolated also the bullock and the ram, the peace offerings of the people: and his sons brought him the blood, which he poured upon the altar round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, and the caul of the liver,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They put upon the breasts. And after the fat was burnt upon the altar,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders, elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
