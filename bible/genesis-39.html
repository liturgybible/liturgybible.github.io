            <p data-verse="39:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master's house,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home, and in the fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> h And after many days his mistress 'cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Neither is there any thing which is hot in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife : how then can I do this wicked thing, and I sin against my God?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now it happened on it certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business without any, man with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me : and when I cried out,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> dummy verses inserted by amos</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou best brought, came to me to abuse me.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife's words, was very angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king's prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done was under him.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.</p>
