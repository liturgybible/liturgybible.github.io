            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the seventeenth year of Phacee the son of Romelia reigned Achaz the son of Joatham king of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Achaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: he did not that which was pleasing in the sight of the Lord his Cod, as David his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel: moreover he consecrated also his son, making him pass through the fire according to the idols of the nations: which the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Basin king of Syria, and Phacee son of Romelia king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to fight: and they besieged Achaz, but were not able to overcome him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> At that time Rasin king of Syria restored Aila to Syria, and drove the men of Juda out of Aila: and the Edomites came into Aila, and dwelt there unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Achaz sent messengers to Theglathphalasar king of the Assyrians, saying: I am thy servant, and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are risen up together against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when he had gathered together the silver and gold that could be found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, he sent it for a present to the king of the Assyrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he agreed to his desire: for the king of the Assyrians went up against Damascus, and laid it waste: and he carried away the inhabitants thereof to Cyrene, but Basin he slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Theglathphalasar king of the Assyrians, end when he had seen the altar of Damascus, king Achaz sent to Urias the priest a pattern of it, and its likeness according to all the work thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Urias the priest built an altar according to all that king Achaz had commanded from Damascus, so did Urias the priest, until king Achaz came from Damascus.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when the king was come from Damascus, he saw the altar and worshipped it: and went up and offered holocausts, and his own sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And offered libations and poured the blood of the peace offerings, which he had offered upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But the altar of brass that was before the Lord, he removed from the face of the temple, and from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple of the Lord: and he set it at the side of the altar toward the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And king Achaz commanded Urias the priest saying: Upon the great altar offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the king's holocaust, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the whole people of the land, and their sacrifices, and their libations: and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim thou shalt pour out upon it: but the altar of brass shall be ready at my pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And king Achaz took away the graven bases, and the laver that was upon them: and he took down the sea from the brazen oxen that held it up, and put it upon a pavement of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Musach also for the sabbath, which he had built in the temple: and the king's entry from without he turned into the temple of the Lord, because of the king of the Assyrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Achaz, which he did, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ezechias his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
