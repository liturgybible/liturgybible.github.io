            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Arphaxad king of the Medes had brought many nations under his dominions, and he built a very strong city, which he called Ecbatana,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Of stones squared and hewed: he made the walls thereof seventy cubits broad, and thirty cubits high, and the towers thereof he made a hundred cubits high. But on the square of them, each side was extended the space of twenty feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he made the gates thereof according to the height of the towers:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he gloried as a mighty one in the force of his army and in the glory of his chariots.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now in the twelfth year of his reign, Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, who reigned in Ninive the great city, fought against Arphaxad and overcame him,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the great plain which is called Ragua, about the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Jadason, in the plain of Erioch the king of the Elicians.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then was the kingdom of Nabuchodonosor exalted, and his heart was elevated: and he sent to all that dwelt in Cilicia and Damascus, and Libanus,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And to the nations that are in Carmelus, and Cedar, and to the inhabitants of Galilee in the great plain of Asdrelon,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And to all that were in Samaria, and beyond the river Jordan even to Jerusalem, and all the land of Jesse till you come to the borders of Ethiopia.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> To all these Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, sent messengers:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But they all with one mind refused, and sent them back empty, and rejected them without honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then king Nabuchodonosor being angry against all that land, swore by his throne and kingdom that he would revenge himself of all those countries.</p>
