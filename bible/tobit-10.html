            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The physician cutteth off it short sickness: so also a king is to day, and to morrow he shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, end beasts, and worms.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from God:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for pride is the beginning of all sin: be that holdeth it, shall be filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the end.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set up the meek in their stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and hath planted the humble of these nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and hath destroyed them even to the foundation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of women.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God: but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the commandments of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable: so shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the honourable, and of the poor:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a sinful man that is rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise: and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be honoured.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Extol not thyself in doing thy work, and linger not in the time of distress:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> My son, keep thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to its desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear: and there is a man that is honoured for his wealth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth? and he that is glorified in wealth, let him fear poverty.</p>
