            <p data-verse="54:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and stretch out the skins of thy tabernacles, spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thou shalt pass on to the right hand, and to the left: and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and shall inhabit the desolate cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Fear not, for thou shalt not be confounded, nor blush: for thou shalt not be put to shame, because thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt remember no more the reproach of thy widowhood.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For he that made thee shall rule over thee, the Lord of hosts is his name: and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, shall be called the God of all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the Lord hath called thee as woman forsaken and mourning in spirit, end se a wife cast off from her youth, said thy God.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For a, small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In a moment of indignation have I hid my face a little while from thee, but with everlasting kindness have I had mercy on thee, said the Lord thy Redeemer.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> This thing is to me as in the days of Noe, to whom I swore, that I would no more bring in the waters of Noe upon the earth: so have I sworn not to be angry with thee, and not to rebuke thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the mountains shall be moved, and the hills shall tremble; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, and the covenant of my peace shall not be moved: said the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> O poor little one, tossed with tempest, without all comfort, behold I will lay thy stones in order, and will lay thy foundations with sapphires,</p>
            <p data-verse="54:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And I will make thy bulwarks of jasper: and thy gates of graven stones, and all thy borders of desirable stones.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> All thy children shall be taught of the Lord: and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And thou shalt be founded in justice: depart far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold, an inhabitant shall come, who was not with me, he that was a stranger to thee before, shall be joined to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and bringeth forth an instrument for his work, and I have created the killer to destroy.</p>
            <p data-verse="54:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper: and every tongue that resisteth thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of the Lord, and their justice with me, saith the Lord.</p>
