            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the world.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to the end thereof: and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For thy servant keepeth them, and in keeping them there is a great reward.</p>

            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> and from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer.</p>
