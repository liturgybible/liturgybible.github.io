            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But God, (who is rich in mercy,) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,)</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places, through Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace, in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not of works, that no man may glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel, and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise, and without God in this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees; that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off, and peace to them that were nigh.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> In whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</p>
