            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.</p>
