            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they are powerful and strong, and willingly agree to all things that are requested of them: and that whosoever have come to them, they have made amity with them, and that they are mighty in power.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they heard of their battles, and their noble acts, which they had done in Galatia, how they conquered them, and brought them under tribute:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And how great things they had done in the land of Spain, and that they had brought under their power the mines of silver and of gold that are there, and had gotten possession of all the place by their counsel and patience:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And had conquered places that were very far off from them, and kings that came against them from the ends of the earth, and had overthrown them with great slaughter: and the rest pay them tribute every year.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And that they had defeated in battle Philip, and Perses the king of the Ceteans, and the rest that had borne arms against them, and had conquered them:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And how Antiochus the great king of Asia, who went to fight against them, having a hundred and twenty elephants, with horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was routed by them:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And how they took him alive, and appointed to him, that both he and they that should reign after him, should pay a great tribute, and that he should give hostages, and that which was agreed upon,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the country of the Indians, and of the Medes, and of the Lydians, some of their best provinces: and those which they had taken from them they gave to king Eumenes.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And that they who were in Greece had a mind to go and to destroy them: and they had knowledge thereof,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they sent a general against them, and fought with them, and many of them were slain, and they carried away their wives and their children captives, and spoiled them, and took possession of their land, and threw down their walls, and brought them to be their servants unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the other kingdoms, and islands, that at any time had resisted them, they had destroyed and brought under their power.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But with their friends, and such as relied upon them, they kept amity, and had conquered kingdoms that were near, and that were far off: for all that heard their name, were afraid of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That whom they had a mind to help to a kingdom, those reigned: and whom they would, they deposed from a kingdom: and they were greatly exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And none of all these wore a crown, or was clothed in purple, to be magnified thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And that they made themselves a senate house, and consulted daily three hundred and twenty men, that sat in council always for the people, that they might do the things that were right.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And that they committed their government to one man every year, to rule over all their country, and they all obey one, and there is no envy, nor jealousy amongst them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, the son of Jacob, and Jason the son of Eleazar, and he sent them to Rome to make a league of amity and confederacy with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And that they might take off from them the yoke of the Grecians, for they saw that they oppressed the kingdom of Israel with servitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they went to Rome, a very long journey, and they entered into the senate house, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Judas Machabeus, and his brethren, and the people of the Jews have sent us to you, to make alliance and peace with you, and that we may be registered your confederates and friends.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the proposal was pleasing in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And this is the copy of the writing that they wrote back again, graven in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that it might be with them there for a memorial of the peace and alliance.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> GOOD SUCCESS BE TO THE ROMANS, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: and far be the sword and enemy from them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But if there come first any war upon the Romans, or any of their confederates, in all their dominions:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The nation of the Jews shall help them according as the time shall direct, with all their heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Neither shall they give them, whilst they are fighting, or furnish them with wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall obey their orders, without taking any thing of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> In like manner also if war shall come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall permit them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And there shall not be given to them that come to their aid, either wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall observe their orders without deceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> According to these articles did the Romans covenant with the people of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And if after this one party or the other shall have a mind to add to these articles, or take away anything, they may do it at their pleasure: and whatsoever they shall add, or take away, shall be ratified.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Moreover concerning the evils that Demetrius the king hath done against them, we have written to him, saying: Why hast thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends, and allies, the Jews?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If therefore they come again to us complaining of thee, we will do them justice, and will make war against thee by sea and land.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, went privily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, and took unto them all such as continued in the Jews’ religion, and assembled about six thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon the people that was trodden down of all; and also pity the temple profaned of ungodly men;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And that he would have compassion upon the city, sore defaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear the blood that cried unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, and the blasphemies committed against his name; and that he would shew his hatred against the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not be withstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turned into mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities, and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcame and put to flight no small number of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But specially took he advantage of the night for such privy attempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spread every where.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So when Philip saw that this man increased by little and little, and that things prospered with him still more and more, he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, to yield more aid to the king’s affairs.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twenty thousand of all nations under him, to root out the whole generation of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias a captain, who in matters of war had great experience.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captive Jews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents, which the king was to pay to the Romans.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the sea coast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promising that they should have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent, not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from the Almighty God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor’s coming, and he had imparted unto those that were with him that the army was at hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God, fled, and conveyed themselves away.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought the Lord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they met together:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he had made with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name’s sake, by which they were called.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of six thousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror of the enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, who came wrongly against them; but to fight manfully,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And to set before their eyes the injury that they had unjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of the city, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away of the government of their forefathers:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; but our confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast down both them that come against us, and also all the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathers had found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon with the Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to the business, with four thousand Macedonians, and that the Macedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed an hundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they had from heaven, and so received a great booty.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and ready to die for the law and the country, he divided his army into four parts;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of each band, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each one fifteen hundred men.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when he had given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leading the first band,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousand of their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part of Nicanor’s host, and so put all to flight;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued them far: but lacking time they returned:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore they would no longer pursue them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiled their enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath, yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercy distilling upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When this was done, and they had made a common supplication, they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with his servants for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, who fought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and very easily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselves many spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, and the aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And when they had gathered their armour together, they laid them up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant of the spoils they brought to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was with Timotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for the victory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had set fire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; and so he received a reward meet for his wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought a thousand merchants to buy the Jews,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, of whom he made least account; and putting off his glorious apparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitive servant through the midland unto Antioch having very great dishonour, for that his host was destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans their tribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that the Jews had God to fight for them, and therefore they could not be hurt, because they followed the laws that he gave them.</p>
