            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy concerning it, and say to it:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, mount Seir, and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will destroy thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy, and hast shut up the children of Israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their affliction, in the time of their last iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will deliver thee up to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and whereas thou hast hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will make mount Seir waste and desolate: and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in thy torrents they shall fall that are slain with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I will make thee everlasting desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because thou hast said: The two nations, and the two lands shall be mine, and I will possess them by inheritance: whereas the Lord was there.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will do according to thy wrath, and according to thy envy, which thou hast exercised in hatred to them: and I will be made known by them, when I shall have judged thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt know that I the Lord have heard all thy reproaches, that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate, they are given to us to consume.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you rose up against me with your mouth, and have derogated from me by your words: I have heard them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thus saith the Lord God: When the whole earth shall rejoice, I will make thee a wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As thou best rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee: thou shalt be laid waste, O mount Seir, and all Idumea: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</p>
            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
