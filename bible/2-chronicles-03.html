            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, in mount Moria, which had been shewn to David his father, in the place which David had prepared in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now these are the foundations, which Solomon laid, to build the house of God, the length by the first measure sixty cubits, the breadth twenty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the porch in the front, which was extended in length according to the measure of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits: and the height was a hundred and twenty cubits: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the greater house he ceiled with deal boards, and overlaid them with plates of fine gold throughout: and he graved in them palm trees, and like little chains interlaced with one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He paved also the floor of the temple with most precious marble, of great beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the doors was of the finest: and he graved cherubims on the walls.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He made also the house of the holy of holies: the length of it according to the breadth of the temple, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it in like manner twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with plates of gold, amounting to about six hundred talents.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He made also nails of gold, and the weight of every nail was fifty sicles: the upper chambers also he overlaid with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He made also in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims of image work: and he overlaid them with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits, so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> In like manner the wing of the other cherub, was five cubits long, and reached to the wall: and his other wing was five cubits long, and touched the wing of the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So the wings of the two cherubims were spread forth, and were extended twenty cubits: and they stood upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the house without.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He made also a veil of violet, purple, scarlet, and silk: and wrought in it cherubims.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He made also before the doors of the temple two pillars, which were five and thirty cubits high: and their chapiters were five cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He made also as it were little chains in the oracle, and he put them on the heads of the pillars: and a hundred pomegranates, which he put between the little chains.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> These pillars he put at the entrance of the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left: that which was on the right hand, he called Jachin: and that on the left hand, Boot.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</p>
