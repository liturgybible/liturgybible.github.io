            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and called together all the house of Juda and of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men and warriors, to fight against Israel, and to bring back his kingdom to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the word of the Lord came to Semeias the man of God, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon the king of Juda, and to all Israel, in Juda and Benjamin:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: let every man return to his own house, for by my will this thing has been done. And when they heard the word of the Lord, they returned, and did not go against Jeroboam,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built walled cities in Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Thecue,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Bethsur, and Socho, and Odollam,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Geth, and Maresa, and Ziph,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Aduram, and Lachis, and Azecha,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Saraa also, and Aialon, and Hebron, which are in Juda and Benjamin, well fenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he had enclosed them with walls, he put in them governors and storehouses of provisions, that is, of oil and of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Moreover in every city he made an armoury of shields and spears, and he fortified them with great diligence, and he reigned over Juda, and Benjamin,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the priests and Levites, that were in all Israel, came to him out of all their seats,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Leaving their suburbs, and their possessions, and passing over to Juda, and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off, from executing the priestly office to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he made to himself priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Moreover out of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever gave their heart to seek the Lord the God of Israel, came into Jerusalem to sacrifice their victims be- fore the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda, and established Roboam the son of Solomon for three years: for they walked in the ways of David and of Solomon, only three years.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Roboam took to wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David: and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Isai.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they bore him sons Jehus, and Somorias, and Zoom.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after her he married Maacha the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abia and Ethai, and Ziza, and Salomith.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Absalom above all his wives, and concubines: for he had married eighteen wives, and threescore concubines: and he beget eight and twenty sons, and threescore daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But he put at the head of them Abia the son of Maacha to be the chief ruler over all his brethren: for he meant to make him king,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Because he was wiser and mightier than all his sons, and in all the countries of Juda, and of Benjamin, and in all the walled cities: and he gave them provisions in abundance, and he sought many wives.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</p>

            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the LORD:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.</p>
