            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Aleph. How is the gold become dim, the finest colour is changed, the stones of the sanctuary are scattered in the top of every street?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Beth. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ghimel. Even the sea monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young: the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Daleth. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets; they that were brought up in scarlet have embraced the dung.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Vau. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Zain. Her Nazarites were whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Heth. Their face is now made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Teth. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jod. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Caph. The Lord hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Lamed. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Mem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Nun. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not help walking in it, they held up their skirts.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Samech. Depart you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Phe. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancient.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Ain. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Sade. Our steps have slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are fulfilled, for our end is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Coph. Our persecutors were swifter than the eagles of the air: they pursued us upon the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Res. The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins: to whom we said: Under thy shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Sin. Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thau. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.  The Prayer of Jeremias the Prophet.</p>
