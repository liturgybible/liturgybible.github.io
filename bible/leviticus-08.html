            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of unction, a calf for sin, two rams, a basket with unleavened bread,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to the door of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And all the multitude being gathered together before the door of the tabernacle,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He said: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And immediately he offered Aaron and his sons: and when he had washed them,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment, girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the violet tunick, and over it he put the ephod,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the rational, on which was Doctrine and Truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He put also the mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated with sanctification, as the Lord had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed the tabernacle, with all the furniture thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof, and the laver with the foot thereof, he sanctified with the oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he poured it upon Aaron's head, and he anointed and consecrated him :</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after he had offered his sons, he vested them with linen tunicks, and girded them with girdles, and put mitres on them as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He offered also the calf for sin: and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon the head thereof,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He immolated it: and took the blood, and dipping his finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar round about. Which being expiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at the bottom thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt upon the altar:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung, he burnt without the camp, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He offered also a ram for a holocaust: and when Aaron and his sons had put their hands upon its head,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the whole ram together he burnt upon the altar, because it was a holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He offered also the second ram, in the consecration of priests: and Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon the head thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when Moses had immolated it, he took of the blood thereof, and touched the tip of Aaron's right ear, and the thumb of his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right foot.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He offered also the sons of Aaron: and when with the blood of the ram that was immolated, he had touched the tip of the right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured on the altar round about:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And taking out of the basket; of unleavened bread, which was before the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and a cake tempered with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Delivering all to Aaron, and to his sons: wile having lifted them up before the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon the altar of holocaust, because it was the oblation of consecration, for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he took of the ram of consecration, the breast for his portion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And taking the ointment, and the blood that was upon the altar, he sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his sons, and their vestments with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And when he had sanctified them in their vestments, he commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of the tabernacle, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of consecration, that are laid in the basket, as the Lord commanded me, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat them:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the leaves, shall be consumed with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your consecration shall be expired. For in seven days the consecration is finished:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> As at this present it hath been done, that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplished.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle observing the watches of the Lord, lest you die: for so it hath been commanded me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord spoke by the hand of Moses.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>

            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>
