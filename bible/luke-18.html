            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
