            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke. And he said to me: Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And saying: Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house: and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words: for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions. Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks: for they are a provoking house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear: for they provoke me to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee: and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up: and he spread it before me, and it was written within and without: and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p>
