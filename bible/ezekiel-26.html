            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, because Tyre hath said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the people are broken, she is turned to me: I shall be filled, now she is laid waste.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, O Tyre, and I will cause many nations to come up to thee, as the waves of the sea rise up.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they shall break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy the towers thereof: and I will scrape her dust from her, and make her like a smooth rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> She shall be a drying place for nets in the midst of the sea, because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God: and she shall be a spoil to the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Her daughters also that are in the field, shall be slain by the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will bring against Tyre Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, the king of kings, from the north, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and companies, and much people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thy daughters that are in the field, he shall kill with the sword: and he shall compass thee with forts, and shall cast up a mount round about: and he shall lift up the buckler against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he shall set engines of mar and battering rams against thy walls, and shall destroy thy towers with his arms.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> By reason of the multitude of his horses, their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and wheels, and chariots, when they shall go in at thy gates, as by the entrance of a city that is destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets: thy people he shall kill with the sword, and thy famous statues shall fall to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They shall waste thy riches, they shall make a spoil of thy merchandise: and they shall destroy thy walls, and pull down thy fine houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber, and thy dust in the midst of the waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be heard no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I will make thee like a naked rock, then shalt be a drying place for nets, neither shalt thou be built any more: for I have spoken it, saith. the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Thus saith the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the islands shake at the sound of thy fall, and the groans of thy slain when they shall be killed in the midst of thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones: and take off their robes, and cast away their broidered garments, and be clothed with astonishment: they shall sit on the ground, and with amazement shall wonder at thy sudden fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And taking up a lamentation over thee, they shall sag to thee: How art thou fallen, that dwellest in the sea, renowned city that wast strong in the sea, with thy inhabitants whom all did dread?</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy terror: and the islands in the sea shall be troubled because no one cometh out of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For thus saith the Lord God: When I shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited: and shall bring the deep upon thee, and many waters shall cover thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the pit to the everlasting people, and shall set thee in the lowest parts of the earth, as places desolate of old, with them that are brought down into the pit, that thou be not inhabited: and when I shall give glory in the land of the living,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I will bring thee to nothing, and thou shalt not be, and if thou be sought for, thou shalt not be found any more for ever, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.</p>
