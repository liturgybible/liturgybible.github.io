            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas be himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not bow to go to the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
