            <p data-verse="35:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me : say to my soul : I am thy salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let them become as dust before the wind : and let the angel of the Lord straiten them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction : without cause they have upbraided my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him : and let the net which he hath hidden catch him : and let the net which he hath hidden catch him : and into that very snare let them fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> All my bones shall say : Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> They repaid me evil for good : to the depriving me of my soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please : as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But they rejoiced against me, and came together : scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They were separated, and repented not : they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn : they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou soul from their malice : my only one from the lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said : Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent : O Lord, depart not from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Arise, and be attentive to my judgment : to my cause, my God, and my Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let them not say in their hearts : It is well, it is well, to our mind : neither let them say : We have swallowed him up.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Let them blush : and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always : The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Any my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="35:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or  brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his  mother.</p>

            <p data-verse="35:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.</p>
