            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Go round about the city, all ye fighting men, once a day: so shall ye do for six days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then Josue the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord walking and sounding the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab the harlot live, with all that are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forth- with fell down: and every man went up by the place that was over against him: s and they took the city,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The oxen also and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the young men went in and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren also and all her goods and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But Josue saved Rahab the harlot and her father's house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all the land.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the young men that were spies went in, and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</p>
