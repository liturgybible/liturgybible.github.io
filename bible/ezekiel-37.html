            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel : they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="37:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="37:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?</p>
            <p data-verse="37:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:</p>
            <p data-verse="37:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="37:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children’s children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="37:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</p>
