            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have loved you, saith the Lord: and you have said: Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and I have loved Jacob,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness, and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The son honoureth the father, and the servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar gratis? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire that devoureth it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you have said: Behold of our labour, and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</p>

And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.</p>
