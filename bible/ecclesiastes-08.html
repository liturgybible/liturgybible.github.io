            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his word is full of power: neither can any man say to him: Why dost thou so?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He that keepeth the commandments shall find no evil. The heart of a wise man understandeth time and answer.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction for man:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he cannot know by any messenger.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> It is not in man's power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand, neither shall wickedness save the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all the works that are done under the sun. Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> I saw the wicked buried: who also when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just works: but this also is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal, I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God, who dread his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But let it not be well with the wicked, neither let his days be prolonged, but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth. There are just men to whom evils happen, as though they had done the works of the wicked: and there are wicked men, who are as secure, as though they had the deeds of the just: but this also I judge most vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which God hath given him under the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the distraction that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works of God that are done under the sun: and the more he shall labour to seek, so much the less shall he find: yea, though the wise man shall say, that he knoweth it, he shall not be able to find it.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>
