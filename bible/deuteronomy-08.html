            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy food, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew: to shew that m not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up his son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee up.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and fear him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of brooks and of waters, and of fountains: in the plains of which and the hills deep rivers break out:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and pomegranates, and oliveyards grow: a land of oil and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy abundance of all things: where the stones are iron, and out of its hills are dug mines of brass:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayst bless the Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I command thee this day:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver, and of all things,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness, wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the dipsas, and no waters at all: who brought forth streams out of the hardest rock,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy on thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt utterly perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.</p>
