            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore the whole multitude crying wept that night.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Would God that we had died in Egypt and would God we may die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away captives. Is it not better to return into Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they said one to another: Let us appoint a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephone, who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their garments,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel: The land which we have gone round is very good:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If the Lord be favourable, he will bring us into it, and give us a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Be not rebellious against the Lord: and fear ye not the people of this land, for we are able to eat them up as bread. All aid is gone from them: the Lord is with us, fear ye not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when all the multitude cried out, and would have stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord said to Moses: How long will this people detract me? how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier than this is.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses said to the Lord: That the Egyptians, from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the inhabitants of this land, (who have heard that thou, O Lord, art among this people, and art seen face to face, and thy cloud protecteth them, and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one man and may say:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He could not bring the people into the land for which he had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Let their the strength of the Lord be magnified, as thou hast sworn, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The Lord is patient and full of mercy, taking away iniquity and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who visitest the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to thy word.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> As I live: and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But yet all the men that have seen my majesty, and the signs that I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now ten times, and have not obeyed my voice,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Shall not see the land for which I aware to their fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> My servant Caleb, who being full of another spirit hath followed me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round: and his seed shall possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys. To morrow remove the camp, and return into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord: According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> fin the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured against me,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my bend to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you have despised.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed ill the desert,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the land: year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall receive your iniquities, and shall know my revenge:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this wilderness shall it faint away and die.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the land, and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was naught,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Josue .the son of Nun. and Caleb the son of Jephone lived, of all them that had gone to view the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Moses said to them: Why transgress you the word of the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with you?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Go not up, for the Lord is not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are before you, and by their sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the Lord, neither will the Lord be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And the Amalecite came down, and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain: and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as Horma.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.</p>
