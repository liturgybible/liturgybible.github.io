            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>
