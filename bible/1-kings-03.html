            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon, and he made affinity with Pharao the king of Egypt: for he took his daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But yet the people sacrificed in the high places: far there was no temple built to the name of the Lord until that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the precepts of David his father, only he sacrificed in the high places: and burnt incense.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He went therefore to Gabaon, to sacrifice there: for that was the great high place: a thousand victims for holocausts did Solomon offer upon that altar in Gabaon.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, saying : Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Solomon said: Thou hast shewn great mercy to thy servant David my father, even at, he walked before thee in truth, and justice, and an upright heart with thee: and thou hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a child, and know not how to go out and come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thy servant is in the midst of the people which thou hast chosen, an immense people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to judge thy people, and discern between good and evil. For who shall be able to judge this people, thy people which is so numerous?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the word was pleasing to the Lord that Solomon had asked such a thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life or riches, nor the lives of thy enemies, but hast asked for thyself wisdom to discern judgment,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and have given thee a wise and understanding heart, insomuch that there hath been no one like thee before thee, nor shall arise after thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yea and the things also which thou didst not ask, I have given thee: to wit riches and glory, as that no one hath been like thee among the kings in all days heretofore.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, and Beep my precepts, and my commandments, as thy father walked, I will lengthen thy days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Solomon awaked, and perceived that it was a dream: and when he was come to Jerusalem, he stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered holocausts, and sacrificed victims of peace offerings, and made a great feast for all his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then there came two women that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And one of them said: I beseech thee, my lord, I and this woman dwelt in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the third day, after that I was delivered, she also was delivered, and we were together, and no other person with us in the house, only we two.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this woman's child died in the night: for in her sleep she overlaid him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And rising in the dead time of the night, she took my child from my side, while I thy handmaid was asleep, and laid it in her bosom: and laid her dead child in my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold it was dead: but considering him more diligently when it was clear day, I found that it was not mine which I bore.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayest, but thy child is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary she said: Thou liest: for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in this manner they strove before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child is dead. And the other answereth: Nay, but thy child is dead, and mine liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The king therefore said: Bring me a sword. And when they had brought a sword before the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Divide, said he, the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But the woman whose child was alive, said to the king, (for her bowels were moved upon her child,) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the child alive, and do not kill it. But the other said: Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The king answered, and said: Give the living child to this woman, and let it not be killed, for she is the mother thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared the king, seeing that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</p>
