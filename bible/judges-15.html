            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest were at hand, Samson came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid of the flock. And when he would have gone into her chamber as usual, her father would not suffer him, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I thought thou hadst hated her, and therefore I gave her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, who is younger and fairer than she, take her to wife instead of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Samson answered him: From this day I shall be blameless in what I do against the Philistines: for I will do you evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail, and fastened torches between the tails.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run about hither and thither. And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines. Which being set on fire, both the corn that was already carried together, and that which was yet standing, was all burnt, insomuch, that the flame consumed also the vineyards and the oliveyards.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the Philistines said: Who hath done this thing? And it was answered: Samson the son in law of the Thamnathite, because he took away his wife, and gave her to another, hath done these things. And the Philistines went up and burnt both the woman and her father.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But Samson said to them: Although you have done this, yet will I be revenged of you, and then I will be quiet.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in astonishment they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh. And going down he dwelt in a cavern of the rock Etam.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda, camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the Jawbone, where their army was spread.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why are you come up against us? They answered: We are come to bind Samson, and to pay him for what he hath done against us.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore three thousand men of Juda, went down to the cave of the rock Etam, and said to Samson: Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? Why wouldst thou do thus? And he said to them: As they did to me, so have I done to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they said to him, We are come to bind thee and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them: Swear to me, and promise me, that you will not kill me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They said: We will not kill thee: but we will deliver thee up bound. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the rock Etam.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the Philistines shouting went to meet him, the spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him: and as the flax is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and loosed.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass which lay there, catching it up, be slew therewith a thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the colt of asses I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he had ended these words singing, he threw the jawbone out of his hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted the lifting up of the jawbone.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Arid being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, and said: Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy servant: and behold I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass, and waters issued out of it. And when he had drank them he refreshed his spirit, and recovered his strength. Therefore the name of that place was called, The Spring of him that invoked from the jawbone, until this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.</p>
