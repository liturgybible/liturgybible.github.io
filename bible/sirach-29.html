            <p data-verse="29:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that is merciful will lend unto his neighbour; and he that strengtheneth his hand keepeth the commandments.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour again in due season.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him, and thou shalt always find the thing that is necessary for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Till he hath received, he will kiss a man’s hand; and for his neighbour’s money he will speak submissly: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings and railings; and for honour he will pay him disgrace.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Many therefore have refused to lend for other men’s ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Yet have thou patience with a man in poor estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Help the poor for the commandment’s sake, and turn him not away because of his poverty.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust under a stone to be lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the most High, and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Shut up alms in thy storehouses: and it shall deliver thee from all affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> It shall fight for thee against thine enemies better than a mighty shield and strong spear.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> An honest man is surety for his neighbour: but he that is impudent will forsake him.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Forget not the friendship of thy surety, for he hath given his life for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A sinner will overthrow the good estate of his surety:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him in danger that delivered him.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Suretiship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A wicked man transgressing the commandments of the Lord shall fall into suretiship: and he that undertaketh and followeth other men’s business for gain shall fall into suits.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Help thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thyself fall not into the same.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The chief thing for life is water, and bread, and clothing, and an house to cover shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Better is the life of a poor man in a mean cottage, than delicate fare in another man’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be it little or much, hold thee contented, that thou hear not the reproach of thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For it is a miserable life to go from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Thou shalt entertain, and feast, and have no thanks: moreover thou shalt hear bitter words:</p>
            <p data-verse="29:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Come, thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feed me of that thou hast ready.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.</p>
            <p data-verse="29:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> These things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of houseroom, and reproaching of the lender.</p>
