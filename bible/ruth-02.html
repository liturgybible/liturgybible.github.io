            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Ruth the Moabitess said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> She went therefore and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he answered him: This is the Moabitess who came with Noemi, from the land of Moab,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> She fell on her face and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me a woman of another country?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayest thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Booz said to her: At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Which she took up and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother in law: moreover she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And her mother in law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned to day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man's name, that he was called Booz.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ruth said, He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And her mother in law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man's field some one may resist thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</p>
