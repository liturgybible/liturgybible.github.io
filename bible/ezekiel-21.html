            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and let thy speech flow towards the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say to the land of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off in thee the just, and the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And forasmuch as I have cut off in thee the just, and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south even to the north.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath not to be turned back.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And thou, son of man, mourn with the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness sigh before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when they shall say to thee: Why mournest thou? thou shalt say: For that which I hear: because it cometh, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and water shall run down every knee: behold it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Say: The sword, the sword is sharpened, and furbished.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> It is sharpened to kill victims: it is furbished that it may glitter: thou removest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down every tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I have given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, that it may be in the hand of the slayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Cry, and howl, 0 son of man, for this sword is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel, that are fled: they are delivered up to the sword with my people, strike therefore upon thy thigh,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Because it is tried: and that when it shall overthrow the sceptre, and it shall not be, saith the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou therefore, O son of man, prophesy, and strike thy hands together, and let the sword be doubled, and let the sword of the slain be tripled: this is the sword of a great slaughter, that maketh them stand amazed,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And languish in heart, and that multiplieth ruins. In all their gates I have set the dread of the sharp sword, the sword that is furbished to glitter, that is made ready for slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Be thou sharpened, go to the right hand, or to the left, which way soever thou hast a mind to set thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will clap my hands together, and will satisfy my indignation: I the Lord have spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And thou son of man, set thee two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and with his hand he shall draw lots, he shall consult at the head of the way of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he inquired of the idols, and consulted entrails.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in howling, to set engines against the gates, to cast up a mount, to build forts.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in vain, and imitating the leisure of sabbaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have remembered your iniquity, and have discovered your prevarications, and your sins have appeared in all your devices: because, I say, you have remembered, you shall be taken with the hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, take off the crown: is it not this that hath exalted the low one, and brought down him that was high?</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> I will shew it to be iniquity, iniquity, iniquity: but this was not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth, and I will give it him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And thou son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach, and thou shalt say: sword, O sword, come out of the scabbard to kill, be furbished to destroy, and to glitter,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Whilst they see vain things in thy regard, and they divine lies: to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded, whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Return into thy sheath. I will judge thee in the place wherein thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And I will pour out upon thee my indignation: in the fire of my rage will I blow upon thee, and will give thee into the hands of men that are brutish and contrive thy destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Thou shalt be fuel for the fire, thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be forgotten: for I the Lord have spoken it.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="21:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,</p>
            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.</p>
