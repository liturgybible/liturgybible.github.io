            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in which I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy prophets, and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord and Saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Knowing this first, that in the last days there shall come deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Saying: Where is his promise or his coming? for since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For this they are wilfully ignorant of, that the heavens were before, and the earth out of water, and through water, consisting by the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of the ungodly men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that all should return to penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the heavens shall pass away with great violence, and the elements shall be melted with heat, and the earth and the works which are in it, shall be burnt up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord, by which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with the burning heat?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice dwelleth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation; as also our most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed, lest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own steadfastness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
