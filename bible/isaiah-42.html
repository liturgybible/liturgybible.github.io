            <p data-verse="42:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He shall not be sad, nor troublesome, till he set judgment in the earth: and the islands shall wait for his law.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens, and stretched them out: that established the earth, and the things that spring out of it: that giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread thereon.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I the Lord have called thee in justice, and taken thee by the hand, and preserved thee. And I have given thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles:</p>
            <p data-verse="42:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring forth the prisoner out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>

            <p data-verse="42:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that will attend and hearken for times to come?</p>
            <p data-verse="42:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Who hath given Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers? hath not the Lord himself, against whom we have sinned? And they would not walk in his ways, and they have not hearkened to his law.</p>
            <p data-verse="42:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he hath poured out upon him the indignation of his fury, and a strong battle, and hath burnt him round about, and he knew not: and set him on fire, and he understood not.</p>
