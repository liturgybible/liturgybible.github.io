            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> (And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> (Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Jesus wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Jesus wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</p>
