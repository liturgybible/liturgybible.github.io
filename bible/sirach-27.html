            <p data-verse="27:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The furnace proveth the potter’s vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> As for a wound, it may be bound up; and after reviling there may be reconcilement: but he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not know whence it cometh.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Mockery and reproach are from the proud; but vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Malice and wrath, even these are abominations; and the sinful man shall have them both.</p>
