            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osse: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So he went, and took Gomer the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived and bore him a son.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy: for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord their God: and Iwill not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.</p>
