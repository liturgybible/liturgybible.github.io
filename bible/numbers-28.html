            <p data-verse="28:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> One you shall offer in the morning, and the other in the evening:</p>
            <p data-verse="28:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the tenth part of an ephi of flour, which shall be tempered with the purest oil, of the measure of the fourth part of a hin.</p>
            <p data-verse="28:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> It is the continual holocaust which you offered in mount Sinai for a most sweet. odour of a sacrifice by fire to the Lord.</p>
