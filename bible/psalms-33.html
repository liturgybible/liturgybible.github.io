            <p data-verse="33:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Sing to him a new canticle, sing well unto him with a loud noise.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the word of the Lord is right, and all his works are done with faithfulness.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He loveth mercy and judgment; the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Gathering together the waters of the sea, as in a vessel; laying up the depths in storehouses.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let all the earth fear the Lord, and let all the inhabitants of the world be in awe of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he spoke and they were made: he commanded and they were created.</p>
