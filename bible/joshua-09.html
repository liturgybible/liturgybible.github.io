            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now When these things were heard of, all the kings beyond the Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains, in the places near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Gathered themselves together, to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind, and one resolution.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Josue had done to Jericho and Hai:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions, laying old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up again,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted with patches, and old garments upon them: the leaves also, which they carried for provisions by the way, were hard, and broken into pieces:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they went to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him, and to all Israel with him: We are come from a far country, desiring to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if so, we can make no league with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue said to them: Who are you? and whence came you?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> They answered: From a very far country thy servants are come in the name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of his power, all the things that he did in Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And to the two kings of the Amorrhites that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, that was in Astaroth:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country said to us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, these leaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces, by being exceeding old.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our feet, by reason of the very long journey are worn out, and almost consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not the mouth of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Josue made peace with them, and entering into a league promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the multitude swore to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities on the third day, the names of which are Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord the God of Israel. Then all the common people murmured against the princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But this we mill do to them: Let their lives be saved, lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood, and bringing in water. As they were speaking these things,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Josue called the Gabaonites and said to them: Why would you impose upon us, saying: We dwell far off from you, whereas you are in the midst of us?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water unto the house of my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They answered: It was told us thy servants, that the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives. compelled by the dread we had of you and we took this counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he gave orders in that day that they should be in the service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the Lord hath chosen.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</p>
