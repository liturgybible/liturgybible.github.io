            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:</p>

            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.</p>
