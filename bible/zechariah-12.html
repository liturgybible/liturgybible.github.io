            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. Thus saith the Lord, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in him :</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of surfeiting to all the people round about: and Juda also shall be in the siege against Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all people: all that shall lift it up shall be rent and torn, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered together against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In that day, saith the Lord, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my eyes upon the house of Juda, and will strike every horse of the nations with blindness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the governors of Juda shall say in their heart: Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of hosts, their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In that day I will make the governors of Juda like a furnace of fire amongst wood, and as a firebrand amongst hay: and they shall devour all the people round about, to the right hand, and to the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Juda, as in the beginning: that the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not boast and magnify themselves against Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In that day shall the Lord protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and he that hath offended among them in that day shall be as David: and the house of David, as that of God, as an angel of the Lord in their sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of prayers: and they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced: and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In that day there shall be a great lamentation in Jerusalem like the lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of Mageddon.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</p>
