            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Esdras was thus praying, and beseeching, and weeping, and lying before the temple of God, there was gathered to him of Israel an exceeding great assembly of men and women and children, and the people wept with much lamentation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to Esdras: We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them that fear the commandment of the Lord our God: let it be done according to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take courage, and do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So Esdras arose, and made the chiefs of the priests and of the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word, and they swore.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water: for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come out of the captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And proclamation was made in Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble together into Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from captivity.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then all the men of Juda, and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days, in the ninth month, the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of the sin, and the rain.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Esdras the priest stood up, and said to them: You have transgressed, and taken strange wives, to add to the sine of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now make confession to the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy word unto us, so be it done.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and me are not able to stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly sinned in this matter,)</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude: and in all our cities, let them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned away from us for this sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then Jonathan the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, Levites, helped them:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the children of the captivity did so. And Esdras the priest, and the men heads of the families in the houses of their fathers, and all by their names, went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</p>
