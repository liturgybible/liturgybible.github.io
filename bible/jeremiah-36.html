            <p data-verse="36:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, that this word came to Jeremias by the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda, and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from the days of Josias even to this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If so be, when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from his wicked way: and I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying: I am shut up, and cannot go into the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Go thou in therefore, and read out of the volume, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people in the house of the Lord on the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the hearing of all Juda that come out of their cities:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If so be they may present their supplication before the Lord, and may return every one from his wicked way: for great is the wrath and indignation which the Lord hath pronounced against this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Baruch the son of Nerias did according to all that Jeremias the prophet had commanded him, reading out of the volume the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that were come together out of the cities of Juda to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias in the house of the Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He went down into the king's house to the secretary's chamber: and behold all the princes sat there, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias, and all the princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read out of the volume in the hearing of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, to Baruch, saying: Take in thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand, and came to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they said to him: Sit down and read these things in our hearing. And Baruch read in their hearing.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon one another with astonishment, and they said to Baruch: We must tell the king all these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they asked him, saying: Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Baruch said to them: With his mouth he pronounced all these words as if he were reading to me: and I wrote in a volume with ink.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the princes said to Baruch: Go, and hide thee, both thou and Jeremias, and let no man know where you are.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they went in to the king into the court: but they laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama the scribe: and they told all the words in the hearing of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume: who bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe, read it in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now the king sat in the winter house, In the ninth month: and there was a hearth before him full of burning coals.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife, and he cast it into the Are, that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on the hearth.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king and all his servants that heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the king, not to burn. the book: and he heard them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech, and Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, to take up Baruch the scribe, and Jeremias the prophet: but the Lord hid them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Take thee again another volume: and write in it all the former words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of Juda hath burnt.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou written therein, and said: The king of Babylon shall come speedily, and shall lay waste this land: and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by night.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they have not heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch the son of Nerias the scribe: who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt with fire: and there were added besides many more words than had been before.</p>

            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.</p>

            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</p>
