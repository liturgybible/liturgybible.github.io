            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then all the multitude of the children of Israel setting forward from the desert of Sin, by their mansions, according to the word of the Lord, encamped in Raphidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they chode with Moses, and said: Give us water, that we may drink. And Moses answered them: Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord said to Moses: God before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and go.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. Moses did so before the ancients of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he called the name of that place Temptation, because the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted the Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst us or not?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in Raphidim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses said to Josue: Choose out men: and go out and fight against Amalec: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill having the rod of God in my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur went up upon the top of the hill.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel overcame: but if he let them down a little, Amalec overcame.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Moses' hands were heavy: so they took a stone, and put under him, and he sat on it: and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands on both sides. And it came to pass that his hands were not weary until sunset.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight, by the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in a book, and deliver it to the ears of Josue: for I will destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses built an altar: and called the name thereof, The Lord my exaltation, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because the hand of the throne of the Lord, and the war of the Lord shall be against Amalec, from generation to generation.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p>
