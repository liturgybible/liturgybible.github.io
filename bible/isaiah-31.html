            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But he that is the wise one hath brought evil, and hath not removed his words: and he will rise up against the house of the wicked, and against the aid of them that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Egypt is man, and not God: and their horses, flesh, and not spirit: and the Lord shall put down his hand, and the helper shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall, and they shall al be confounded together.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the Lord to me: Like as the lion roareth, and the lion's whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of shepherds shall come against him, he will not fear at their voice, nor be afraid of their multitude: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight upon mount Sion, and upon the hill thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As birds dying, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem, protecting and delivering, passing over and saving.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Return as you had deeply revolted, O children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For in that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Assyrian shall fall by the sword not of a man, and the sword not of a man shall devour him, and he shall flee not at the face of the sword: and his young men shall be tributaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his strength shall pass away with dread, and his princes fleeing shall be afraid: the Lord hath said it, whose die is in Sion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p>

            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it.</p>
