            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hands of the Philistines forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the race of Dan, whose name was Manue, and his wife was barren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And an angel of the Lord appeared to her, and said: Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive and bear a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazarite of God, from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when she was come to her husband she said to him: A man of God came to me, having the countenance of an angel, very awful. And when I asked him who he was, and whence he came, and by what name he was called, he would not tell me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy, from his mother's womb until the day of his death.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then Manue prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, that the mail of God, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the child that shall be born.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue, and the angel of the Lord appeared again to his wife as she was sitting in the field. But Manue her husband was not with her. And when she saw the angel,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> She made haste and ran to her husband: and told him saying: Behold the man hath appeared to me whom I saw before.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He rose up and followed his wife: and coming to the man, said to him: Art thou he that spoke to the woman? And he answered: I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Manue said to him: When thy word shall come to pass, what wilt thou that the child should do? or from what shall he keep himself?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the angel of the Lord said to Manue: From all the things I have spoken of to thy wife, let her refrain herself:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: and whatsoever I have commanded her, let her fulfil and observe.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the angel answered him: If thou press me, I will not eat of thy bread: but if thou wilt offer a holocaust, offer it to the Lord. And Manue knew not it was the angel of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shall come to pass, we may honour thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he answered him: Why askest thou my name, which is wonderful?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then Manue took a kid of the flocks, and the libations, and put them upon a rock, offering to the Lord, who doth wonderful things: and he and his wife looked on.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven, the angel of the lord ascended also in the flame. And when Manue and his wife saw this, they fell flat on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue understood that it was an angel of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die, because we have seen God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to kill us, he would not have received a holocaust and libations at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And she bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>
