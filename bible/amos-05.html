            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is none to raise her up.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye me, and you shall live.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to quench Bethel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice in the land,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night: that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The Lord is his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the strong, and waste upon the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous sine: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor in the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time, for it is an evil time.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have said.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the remnant of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in lamentation to lament.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light: and obscurity, and no brightness in it?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert for forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.</p>
