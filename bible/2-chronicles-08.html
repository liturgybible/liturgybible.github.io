            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And at the end of twenty years after Solomon had built the house of the Lord and his own house:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He built the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He went also into Emath Suba, and possessed it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built other strong cities in Emath.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, walled cities with Rates and bars and locks.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Balaath also and all the strong cities that were Solomon's, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen. All that Solomon had a mind, and designed, he built in Jerusalem and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> All the people that were left of the Hethites, and the Amorrhites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites, that were not of the stock of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Of their children, and of the posterity, whom the children of Israel had not slain, Solomon made to be the tributaries, unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But of the children of Israel he set none to serve in the king's works: for they were men of war, and chief captains, and rulers of his chariots and horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the chief captains of king Solomon's army were two hundred and fifty, who taught the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he removed the daughter of Pharao from the city of David, to the house which he had built for her. For the king said: My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for it is sanctified: because the ark of the Lord came into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Solomon offered holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of the Lord which he had built before the porch,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That every day an offering might be made on it according to the ordinance of Moses, in the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the festival days three times a year, that is to say, in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he appointed according to the order of David his father the offices of the priests in their ministries: and the Levites in their order to give praise, and minister before the priests according to the duty of every day: and the porters in their divisions by gate and gate: for so David the man of God had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the priests and Levites departed not from the king's commandments, as to any thing that he had commanded, and as to the keeping of the treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Solomon had all charges prepared, from the day that he founded the house of the Lord, until the day wherein he finished it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then Solomon went to Asiongaber, and to Ailath, on the coast of the Red Sea, which is in the land of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants, and skilful mariners, and they went with Solomon's servants to Ophir, and they took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And these were the chief of king Solomon’s officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</p>
