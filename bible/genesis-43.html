            <p data-verse="43:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again and buy us a little food.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the atteststion of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you bring your youngest brother with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see my face without your youngest brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery in that you told him you had also another brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: Bring hither your brother with you?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Juda said to his father: Send the bou with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against thee for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And take also your brother, and go to the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And may my almighty Bod make him favourable to you; and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without children.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.\</p>
            <p data-verse="43:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore going up to the steward of the house, at the door,</p>
            <p data-verse="43:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us: We came down once before to buy food:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when we had bought, and come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your Father hath given you treasure in your sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Joseph came into his house, and they offered him the presents holding them in their hands, and they bowed down with their face to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But he, courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom uou told me? Is he yet living?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they answered: Thy servant our father is in health, he is yet living. And bowing themselves they made obeisance to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his brother, by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he made haste becouse his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: And going into his chamber he wept.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him, apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane:)</p>
            <p data-verse="43:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="43:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the famine was sore in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</p>
            <p data-verse="43:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</p>
            <p data-verse="43:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</p>
            <p data-verse="43:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>
            <p data-verse="43:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
