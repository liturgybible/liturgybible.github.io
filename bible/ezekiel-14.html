            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And some of the ancients of Israel came to me, and sat before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Son of man, these men have placed their uncleannesses in their hearts, and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their iniquity : and shall I answer when they inquire of me?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore speak to them, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Man, man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses in his heart, and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him: I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart, with which they have departed from me through all their idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Be converted, and depart from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among the proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his idols in his heart, and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him: I the Lord will answer him by myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people: and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when the prophet shall err, and speak a word: I the Lord have deceived that prophet: and I will stretch forth my hand upon him, and will cut him off from the midst of my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they shall bear their iniquity: according to the iniquity of him that inquireth, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor be polluted with all their transgressions: but may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof: and I will send famine upon it, and will destroy man and beast out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it: they shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to waste it, and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass because of the beasts:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters: but they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be made desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword: Pass through the land: and I destroy man and beast out of it:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And these three men be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they themselves alone shall be delivered.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Noe, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter: but they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For thus saith the Lord: Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem my four grievous judgments, the sword, and the famine, and the mischievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy out of it man and beast,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved, who shall bring away their sons and daughters: behold they shall come among you, and you shall see their way, and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, in all things that I have brought upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they shall comfort you, when you shall see their ways, and their doings : and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord God.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
