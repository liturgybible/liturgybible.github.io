            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He said to Nathan the prophet: Dost thou see that I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God is lodged within skins?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Nathan said to the king: Go, do all that is in thy heart: because the Lord is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Go, and say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord: Shalt thou build me a house to dwell in?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereas I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt even to this day: but have walked in a tabernacle, and in a tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In all the places that I have gone through with all the children of Israel, did ever I speak a word to any one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And now thus shalt thou speak to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: a I took thee out of the pastures from following the sheep to be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I have been with thee wheresoever thou hast walked, and have slain all thy enemies from before thy face: and I have made thee a great man, like unto the name of the great ones that are on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell therein, and shall be disturbed no more: neither shall the children of iniquity afflict them any more as they did before,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> From the day that I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thy enemies. And the Lord foretelleth to thee, that the Lord will make thee a house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He shall build a house to my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son: and if he commit any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thy house shall be faithful, and thy kingdom for ever before thy face, and thy throne shall be firm for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And David went in, and sat before the Lord, and said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But yet this hath seemed little in thy sight, O Lord God, unless thou didst also speak of the house of thy servant for a long time to come: for this is the law of Adam, O Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord God:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart thou hast done all these great things, so that thou wouldst make it known to thy servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore thou art magnified, O Lord God, because there is none like to thee, neither is there any God besides thee, in all the things that we have heard with our ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And what nation is there upon earth, as thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for them great and terrible things, upon the earth, before the face of thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thyself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be an everlasting people: and thou, O Lord God, art become their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now, O Lord God, raise up for ever the word that thou hast spoken, concerning thy servant and concerning his house: and do as thou hast spoken,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> That thy name may be magnified for ever, and it may be said: The Lord of hosts is God over Israel. And the house of thy servant David shall be established before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Because thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to the ear of thy servant, saying: I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And now, O Lord God, thou art God, and thy words shall be true: for thou hast spoken to thy servant these good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And now begin, and bless the house of thy servant, that it may endure for ever before thee: because thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>
