            <p data-verse="64:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> They would melt as at the burning of fire, the waters would burn with fire, that thy name might be made known to thy enemies: that the nations might tremble at thy presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> When thou shalt do wonderful things, we shall not bear them: thou didst come down, and at thy presence the mountains melted away.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears: the eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou hast met him that rejoiceth, and doth justice: in thy ways they shall remember thee: behold thou art angry, and we have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="64:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And we are all become as one unclean, and all our justices as the rag of a menstruous woman: and we have all fallen as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>
