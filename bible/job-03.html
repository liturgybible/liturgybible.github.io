            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> and he said:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts ?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Job spake, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>
