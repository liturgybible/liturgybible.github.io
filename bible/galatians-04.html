            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> You observe days, and months, and times, and years.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</p>

            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</p>
