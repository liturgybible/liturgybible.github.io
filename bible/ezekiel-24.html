            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, write thee the name of this day, on which the king of Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking house, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Set on a pot, set it on, I say, and put water into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Heap together into if the pieces thereof, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones under it: the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Heap together the bones, which I will burn with Are: the flesh shall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the bones shall be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted: and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, not even by fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Thy uncleanness is execrable: be- cause I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness: neither shalt thou be cleansed, before I cause my indignation to rest in thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I the Lord have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified: I will judge thee according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke: and thou shalt not lament, nor weep : neither shall thy tears run down.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead: let the tire of thy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy face, nor eat the meat of mourners.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening: and I did in the morning as he had commanded me.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the people said to me: Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou doest?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Speak to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that your eyes de sire, and for which your soul feareth: your sons, and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat of mourners.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet: you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and every one shall sigh with his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the desire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
