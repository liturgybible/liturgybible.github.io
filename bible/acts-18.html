            <p data-verse="18:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, departing from Athens, he came to Corinth.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife, (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome,) he came to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought; (now they were tentmakers by trade.)</p>
            <p data-verse="18:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews, that Jesus is the Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his garments, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And departing thence, he entered into the house of a certain man, named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house was adjoining to the synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord said to Paul in the nights, by a vision: Do not fear, but speak; and hold not thy peace,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because I am with thee: and no man shall set upon thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Saying: This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If it were some matter of injustice, or an heinous deed, O Jews, I should with reason bear with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if they be questions of word and names, and of your law, look you to it: I will not be judge of such things.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he drove them from the judgment seat.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment seat; and Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shorn his head in Cenchrae: for he had a vow.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there. But he himself entering into the synagogue, disputed with the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when they desired him, that he would tarry a longer time, he consented not;</p>
            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But taking his leave, and saying: I will return to you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, and saluted the church, and so came down to Antioch.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, confirming all the disciples.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the scriptures.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, spoke, and taught diligently the things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> This man therefore began to speak boldly in the synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of the Lord more diligently.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the brethren exhorting, wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who, when he was come, helped them much who had believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly, shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the Christ.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>

            <p data-verse="18:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</p>
            <p data-verse="18:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>
            <p data-verse="18:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="18:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>

            <p data-verse="18:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>
