            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David returned from the slaughter of the Amalecites, and abode two days in Siceleg.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul's camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head: and when he came to David, he fell upon his face, and adored.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David said to him: From whence comest thou? And he said to him: I am fled out of the camp of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David said unto him: What is the matter that is come to pass? tell me. He said: The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people are fallen and dead: moreover Saul and Jonathan his son are slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said to the young man that told him: How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the young man that told him, said: I came by chance upon mount Gelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear: and the chariots and horsemen drew nigh unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me. And I answered, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said to me: Who art thou? And I said to him: I am an Amalecite.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So standing over him, I killed him: for I knew that he could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither to thee, my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said to the young man that told him: Whence art thou? He answered: I am the son of a stranger of Amalee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> David said to him: Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to kill the Lord's anointed?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David calling one of his servants, said: Go near and fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David said to him: Thy blood be upon thy own head: for thy own mouth hath spoken against thee, saying: I have slain the Lord's anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> (Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.) And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains: how are the valiant fallen?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come upon you, neither be they fields of firstfruits: for there was cast away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant, the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with scarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your attire.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How are the valiant fallen in battle? Jonathan slain in the high places?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan: exceeding beautiful, and amiable to me above the love of women. As the mother loveth her only son, so did I love thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished?</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>
