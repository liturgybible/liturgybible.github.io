            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman built it by his skill.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though a man went to sea without art.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel, and left to all ages a seed of generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, being corruptible, it was called god.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation: because in the creature of God they are become an abomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritual fornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, and therefore shall they come shortly to an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hath made an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him as a god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by the commandments of kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and made an express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority, forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, took him now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled: but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him by adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> So that there reigned in all men without exception blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns, defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies, or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life; though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols, and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it is the just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offence of the ungodly.</p>
