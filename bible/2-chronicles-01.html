            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him to a high degree.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and to the rulers, and to the judges of all Israel, and the heads of the families:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he went with all the multitude to the high place of Gabaon, where was the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, which Moses the servant of God made, in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For David had brought the ark of God from Cariathiarim to the place, which he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the altar of brass, which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon and all the assembly sought it:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up on it a thousand victims.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And behold that night God appeared to him, saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Solomon said to God: Thou hast shewn great kindness to my father David: and hast made me king in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now therefore, O Lord God, let thy word be fulfilled, which thou hast promised to David my father: for thou hast made me king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may come in and go out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people, which is so great?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God said to Solomon: Because this choice hath pleased thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, and wealth, and glory, nor the lives of them that hate thee, nor many days of life: but hast asked wisdom and knowledge, to be able to judge my people, over which I have made thee king,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and glory, so that none of the kings before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Solomon came from the high place of Gabaon to Jerusalem before the tabernacle of the covenant, and reigned over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees as sycamores, which grow in the plains in great multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And there were horses brought him from Egypt, and from Coa by the king's merchants, who went, and bought at a price,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> A chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: in like manner market was made in all the kingdoms of the Hethites, and of the kings of Syria.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</p>
