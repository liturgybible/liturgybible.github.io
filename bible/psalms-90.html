            <p data-verse="90:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Turn not man away to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night,</p>
            <p data-verse="90:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered spider:</p>
            <p data-verse="90:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> the days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For mildness is come upon us: and we shall be corrected.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear</p>
            <p data-verse="90:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.</p>

            <p data-verse="90:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins  in the light of thy countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our  hearts unto wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="90:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>
