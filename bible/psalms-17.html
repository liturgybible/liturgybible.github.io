            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways.</p>
