            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> That you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only that he who now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth; and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, him,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit, and faith of the truth:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore, brethren, stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word, or by our epistle.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</p>

            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
