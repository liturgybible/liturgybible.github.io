            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And going up into a mountain, he sat there.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,</p>
