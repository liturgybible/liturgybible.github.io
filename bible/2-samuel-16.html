            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on: and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine to drink if any man be faint in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace before thee, my lord, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went on,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the right, and on the left side of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out, come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done so?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as the Lord hath bidden him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting stones at him, and scattering earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the king and all the people with him came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and Achitophel was with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee also.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may be strengthened with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with Absalom.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</p>
