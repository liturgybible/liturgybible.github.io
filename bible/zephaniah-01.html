            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Gathering, I will gather together all things from off the face of the land, saith the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will gather man, and beast, I will gather the birds of the air, and the fishes of the sea: and the ungodly shall meet with ruin: and I will destroy men from off the face of the land, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I will destroy out of this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the wardens of the temples with the priests:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And them that worship the host of heaven upon the tops of houses, and them that adore, and swear by the Lord, and swear by Melchom.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And them that turn away from following after the Lord, and that have not sought the Lord, nor searched after him.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the Lord, that I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons, and upon all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will visit in that day upon every one that entereth arrogantly over the threshold: them that fill the house of the Lord their God with iniquity and deceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a great destruction from the hills.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Howl, ye inhabitants of the Morter. All the people of Chanaan is hush, all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, nor will he do evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and exceeding swift: the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall there meet with tribulation.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high bulwarks.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as earth, and their bodies as dung.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: all the land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy, for he shall make even a speedy destruction of all them that dwell in the land.</p>
