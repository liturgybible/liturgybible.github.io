            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread ?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.</p>
