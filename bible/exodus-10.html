            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants: that I may work these my signs in him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And thou mayest tell in the ears of thy sons, and of they grandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and wrought my signs amongst them: and you may know that I am the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: How long refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to sacrifice to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring in to morrow the locust into thy coasts:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To cover the face of the earth that nothing thereof may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Egyptians: such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day. And he turned himself away, and went forth from Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Pharao's servants said to him: How long shall we endure this scandal? let the men go to sacrifice to the Lord their God. Dost thou not see that Egypt is undone?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they called back Moses and Aaron to Pharao: and he said to them: Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God: who are they that shall go?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moses said: We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, with our sheep and herds: for it is the solemnity of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Pharao answered: So be the Lord with you, as I shall let you and your children go: who can doubt but that you intend some great evil?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> It shall not be so: but go ye men only, and sacrifice to the Lord: for this yourselves also desired. And immediately they were cast out from Pharao's presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt unto the locust, that it may come upon it, and devour every herb that is left after the hail.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of Egypt: and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day, and night: and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the locusts:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And they came up over the whole land of Egypt: and rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians innumerable, the like as had not been before that time, nor shall be hereafter.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left: and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth in all Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Wherefore Pharao in haste called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But now forgive me my sin this time also, and pray to the Lord your God, that he take away from me this death.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharao, prayed to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west, and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea: there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out they hand towards heaven: and may there be darkness upon the land of Egypt, so thick that it may be felt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses stretch forth his hand towards heaven: and there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> No man saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the place where he was: but wheresoever the children of Israel dwelt there was light.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheep only, and herds remain; let your children go with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Moses said: Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, to the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> All the flocks shall go with us: there shall not a hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of the Lord our God: especially as we know not what must be offered, till we come to the very place.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he would not let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Pharao said to Moses: Get thee from me, and beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight, thou shalt die.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Moses answered: So shall it be as thou hast spoken, I will not see thy face any more.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</p>
