            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Where pride is, there also shall be reproach: but where humility is, there also is wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The simplicity of the just shall guide them: and the deceitfulness of the wicked shall destroy them.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The justice of the upright shall make his way prosperous: and the wicked man shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> The justice of the righteous shall deliver them: and the unjust shall be caught in their own snares.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> When the wicked man is dead, there shall be no hope any more: and the expectation of the solicitous shall perish.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The just is delivered out of distress: and the wicked shall be given up for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend: but the just shall be delivered by knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When it goeth well with the just the city shall rejoice: and when the wicked perish there shall be praise.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> By the blessing of the just the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the wicked it shall be overthrown.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that despiseth his friend, is mean of heart: but the wise man will hold his peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that walketh deceitfully, revealeth secrets: but he that is faithful, concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He that hideth up corn, shall be cursed among the people: but a blessing upon the head of them that sell.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Well doth he rise early who seeketh good things; but he that seeketh after evil things shall be oppressed by them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the just shall spring up as a green leaf.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He that troubleth his own house, shall inherit the winds: and the fool shall serve the wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The fruit of the just man is a tree of life: and he that gaineth souls, is wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If the just man receive in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>
