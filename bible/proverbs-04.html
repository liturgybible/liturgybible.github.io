            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend that you may know prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For I also was my father's son, tender and as an only son in the sight of my mother:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For they sleep not except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards and increaseth even to perfect day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.</p>
