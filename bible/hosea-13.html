            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore they shall be as a morning aloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the dust that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt know no God but me, and there is no saviour beside me.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I knew thee in the desert, in the land of the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> According to their pastures they were filled, and were made full: and they lifted up their heart, and have forgotten me.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I will meet them as a bear that is robbed of her whelps, and I will rend the inner parts of their liver: and I will devour them there as a lion, the beast of the field shall tear them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Destruction is thy own, 0 Israel: thy help is only in me.</p>
