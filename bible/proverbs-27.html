            <p data-verse="27:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?</p>
            <p data-verse="27:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Open rebuke is better than hidden love.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb : and a soul that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thy own friend, and thy father's friend forsake not: and go not into thy brother's house in the day of thy affliction. Better is a neighbour that is near, than a brother afar off.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself: little ones passing on have suffered losses.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and take from him a pledge for strangers.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He that blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising in the night, shall be like to him that curseth.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Roofs dropping through in a cold day, and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He that retaineth her, is as he that would hold the wind, and shall call in the oil of his right hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: and he that is the keeper of his master, shall be glorified.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so-the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> As silver is tried in the fining-pot and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider thy own flocks :</p>
            <p data-verse="27:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given to generation and generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered out of the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Let the milk of the goats be enough for thy food, and for the necessities of thy house, and for maintenance for thy handmaids.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</p>

            <p data-verse="27:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
            <p data-verse="27:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</p>
