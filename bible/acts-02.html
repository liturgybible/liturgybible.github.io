            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears receive my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David; that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And fear came upon every soul: many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all, according as every one had need.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved.</p>
