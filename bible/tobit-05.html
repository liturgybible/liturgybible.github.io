            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not: I have enough to live on: for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Say not: I have sinned, and whet harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient rewarder.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And say not: The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For mercy and wrath quickly come from him, and his wrath looketh upon sinners.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten: for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand: and return a true answer with wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful word, and be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Justify alike the small and the great.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe and family thou art.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or an hired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I would know, brother, thy kindred and name.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, and of thy brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angry with me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock: for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, as we went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered the firstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were not seduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art of a good stock.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachm a day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thy wages.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things for the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man’s dog with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?</p>
            <p data-verse="5:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shall return in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For the good angel will keep him company, and his journey shall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then she made an end of weeping.</p>
