            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; end if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</p>
