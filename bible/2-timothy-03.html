            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:</p>
