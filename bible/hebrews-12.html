            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And therefore we also having so great a cloud of witnesses over our head, laying aside every weight and sin which surrounds us, let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who having joy set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and now sitteth on the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For you have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And you have forgotten the consolation, which speaketh to you, as unto children, saying: My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord; neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Persevere under discipline. God dealeth with you as with his sons; for what son is there, whom the father doth not correct?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are made partakers, then are you bastards, and not sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh, for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits, and live?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they indeed for a few days, according to their own pleasure, instructed us: but he, for our profit, that we might receive his sanctification.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy, but sorrow: but afterwards it will yield, to them that are exercised by it, the most peaceable fruit of justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And make straight steps with your feet: that no one, halting, may go out of the way; but rather be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Follow peace with all men, and holiness: without which no man shall see God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up do hinder, and by it many be defiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau; who for one mess, sold his first birthright.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For know ye that afterwards, when he desired to inherit the benediction, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, although with tears he had sought it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For you are not come to a mountain that might be touched, and a burning fire, and a whirlwind, and darkness, and storm,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they that heard excused themselves, that the word might not be spoken to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For they did not endure that which was said: And if so much as a beast shall touch the mount, it shall be stoned.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And so terrible was that which was seen, Moses said: I am frighted, and tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of angels,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And to the church of the firstborn, who are written in the heavens, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the just made perfect,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And to Jesus the mediator of the new testament, and to the sprinkling of blood which speaketh better than that of Abel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> See that you refuse him not that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spoke upon the earth, much more shall not we, that turn away from him that speaketh to us from heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Whose voice then moved the earth; but now he promiseth, saying: Yet once more, and I will move not only the earth, but heaven also.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And in that he saith, Yet once more, he signifieth the translation of the moveable things as made, that those things may remain which are immoveable.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Therefore receiving an immoveable kingdom, we have grace; whereby let us serve, pleasing God, with fear and reverence.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For our God is a consuming fire.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For our God is a consuming fire.</p>
