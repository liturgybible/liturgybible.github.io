            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Instead of a friend become not an enemy; for thereby thou shalt inherit an ill name, shame, and reproach: even so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull straying alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire.</p>
