            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And in the I eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate that was between the two walls, and they went; out to the way of the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them: and they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho, and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in Reblatha, before his eyes: and the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He also put out the eyes of Sedecias: and bound him with fetters, to be carried to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Chaldeans burnt the king's house, and the houses of the people with fire, and they threw down the wall of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of the people that remained.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people that had nothing at all, in the land of Juda, and he gave them vineyards, and cisterns at that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm: but as he hath a mind, so do with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabusezban, and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the nobles of the king of Babylon,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Codolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, that he might go home, and dwell among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, when he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Go, and tell Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good: and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou fearest:</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword : but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="39:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;</p>
            <p data-verse="39:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="39:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="39:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.</p>
