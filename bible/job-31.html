            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend's door:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> (For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother's womb :)</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:</p>

            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was not able to bear.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in brightness:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.</p>

            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>

            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>

            <p data-verse="31:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
