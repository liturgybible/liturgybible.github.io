            <p data-verse="36:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Beseleel, therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Moses had called them, and every skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is necessary.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier's voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering gifts,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He made also loops of violet in the edge of the curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That the loops might meet on against another, and might be joined each with the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red: and another cover over that of violet skins.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The length of one board was ten cubits: and the breadth was one cubit and a half.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Of which twenty were at the south side southward,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh toward the north, he made twenty boards.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> So there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And five others to join together the boards of the other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with embroidery:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And four pillars of setim wood, which with their heads be overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an embroiderer.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</p>

            <p data-verse="36:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers’ skins above that.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,</p>
            <p data-verse="36:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;</p>
            <p data-verse="36:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.</p>
