            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the chief priests accused him in many things.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But they again cried out: Crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Save thyself, coming down from the cross.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)</p>
            <p data-verse="15:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>

            <p data-verse="15:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>

            <p data-verse="15:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>
