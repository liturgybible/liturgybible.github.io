            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the people marched from Haseroth, and pitched their tents in the desert of Pharan.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Send men to view the land of Chanaan, which I will give to the children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the rulers.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Moses did what the Lord had commanded, sending from the desert of Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of Zechur.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of Hurl.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of Nun.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the son of Sodi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre of Manasses, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of Michael.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the son of Vapsi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of Machi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> These are the names of the men, whom Moses sent to view the land: and he called Osee the son of Nun, Josue.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan, and said to them: Go you up by the south side. And when you shall come to the mountains,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> View the land, of what sort it is: and the people that are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in number or many:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> The land itself, whether it be good or bad: what manner of cities, walled or without walls:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The ground, fat or barren, woody or without trees. Be of good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be eaten.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades. And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the fruits of the land:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they related and said: We came into the land to which thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as may be known by these fruits:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are great and walled. We saw there the race of Enac.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hethite and the Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains: but the Chanaanite abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> In the mean time Caleb, to still the murmuring of the people that rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and possess the land, for we shall be able to conquer it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than we.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed, before the children of Israel, saying: The land which we have viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld, are of a tall stature.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> There we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac, of the giant kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like locusts.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p>
