            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Benadad, king of Syria, gathered together all his host, and there were two and thirty kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and going up, he fought against Samaria, and besieged it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And, sending messengers to Achab king of Israel into the city,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He said: Thus saith Benadad: Thy silver, and thy gold is mine: and thy wives, and thy goodliest children are mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king of Israel answered: According to thy word, my lord 0 king, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the messengers came again, and said: Thus saith Benadad, who sent us unto thee: Thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children thou shalt deliver up to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> To morrow therefore at this same hour I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants: and all that pleaseth them, they shall put in their hands, and take away.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the king of Israel called all the ancients of the land, and said: Mark, and see that he layeth snares for us. For he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver and gold: and I said not nay.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the ancients, and all the people said to him: Hearken not to him, nor consent to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore he answered the messengers of Benadad: Tell my lord the king: All that thou didst send for to me thy servant at first, I will do: but this thing I cannot do.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the messengers returning brought him word. And he sent again and said: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and more may they add, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king of Israel answering, said: Tell him: Let not the girded boast himself as the ungirded.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, when Benadad heard this word, that he and the kings were drinking in pavilions, and he said to his servants: Beset the city. And they beset it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And behold a prophet coming to Achab king of Israel, said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Hast thou seen all this exceeding great multitude, behold I will deliver them into thy hand this day: that thou mayest know that I am the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Achab said: By whom? And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. And he said: Who shall begin to fight? And he said: Thou.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So he mustered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and he found the number of two hundred and thirty-two: and he mustered after them the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they went out at noon. But Benadad was drinking himself drunk in his pavilion, and the two and thirty kings with him, who were come to help him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benadad sent. And they told him, saying: There are men come out of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said: Whether they come for peace, take them alive: or whether they come to fight, take them alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out, and the rest of the army followed:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And every one slew the man that came against him: and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued after them. And Benadad king of Syria fled away on horseback with his horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But the king of Israel going out overthrew the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> (And a prophet coming to the king of Israel, said to him: Go, and strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou dost: for the next year the king of Syria will come up against thee.)</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they have overcome us: but it is better that we should fight against them in the plains, and we shall overcome them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Do thou therefore this thing: Remove all the kings from thy army, and put captains in their stead:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And make up the number of soldiers that have been slain of thine, and horses according to the former horses, and chariots according to the chariots which thou hadst before: and we will fight against them in the plains, and thou shalt see that we shall overcome them. He believed their counsel and did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wherefore at the return of the year, p Benadad mustered the Syrians, ancient up to Aphec, to fight against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the children of Israel were mustered, and taking victuals went out on the other side, and camped over against them, like two little hocks of goats: but the Syrians filled the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> (And a man of God coming, said to the king of Israel: Thus saith the Lord: Because the Syrians have said: The Lord is God of the hills, but is not God of the valleys: I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.)</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And both sides set their armies in array one against the other seven days, and on the seventh day the battle was fought: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they that remained fled to Aphec, into the city: and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand men, that were left. And Benadad fleeing went into the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful: so let us put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will save our lives.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said to him: Thy servant Benadad saith: I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he be yet alive he is my brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> The men took this for a sign: and in haste caught the word out of his mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he said to them: Go, and bring him to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up into his chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy father, I will restore: and do thou make thee streets in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria, and having made a league I will depart from thee. So he made a league with him, and let him go.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his companion in the word of the Lord: Strike me. But he would not strike.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word of the Lord, behold then shalt depart from me, and a lion shall slay thee. And when he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then he found another man, and said to him: Strike me. And he struck him, and wounded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> So the prophet went, and met the king in the way, and disguised himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy servant went out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain man was run away, one brought him to me, and said: Keep this man: and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And whilst I in a hurry turned this way and that, on a sudden he was not to be seen. And the king of Israel said to him: This is thy judgment, which thyself hast decreed.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face, and the king of Israel knew him, that he was one of the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a mall worthy of death, thy life shall be for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the king of Israel returned to his house, slighting to hear, and raging came into Samaria.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="20:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,</p>
            <p data-verse="20:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</p>
            <p data-verse="20:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:</p>
            <p data-verse="20:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="20:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.</p>
