            <p data-verse="59:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But your iniquities have divided between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he should not hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There is none that calleth upon justice, neither is there any one that judgeth truly: but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak vanities: they have conceived labour, and brought forth iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They have broken the eggs of asps, and have woven the webs of spiders: he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die: and that which is brought out, shall be hatched into a basilisk.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are unprofitable works, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts: wasting and destruction are in their ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their steps: their paths are become crooked to them, every one that treadeth in them, knoweth no peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore is judgment far from us, and justice shall not overtake us. We looked for light, and behold darkness: brightness, and we have walked in the dark.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noonday as in darkness, we are in dark places as dead men.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as mournful doves. We have looked for judgment, and there is none: for salvation, and it is far from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us: for our wicked doings are with us, and we have known our iniquities:</p>
            <p data-verse="59:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In sinning and lying against the Lord: and we have turned away so that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and transgression : we have conceived, and uttered from the heart, words of falsehood.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far off: because truth bath fallen down in the street, and equity could not come in.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his eyes, because there is no judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported him.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with zeal as with a cloak.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to the islands.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord: and they from the rising of the sun, his glory: when he shall come as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth on:</p>
            <p data-verse="59:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there shall come a, redeemer to Sion, and to them that return from iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My spirit that is in thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

            <p data-verse="59:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</p>
            <p data-verse="59:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;</p>
            <p data-verse="59:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="59:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</p>
