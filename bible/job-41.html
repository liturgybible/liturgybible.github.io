            <p data-verse="41:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</p>

            <p data-verse="41:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>

            <p data-verse="41:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
            <p data-verse="41:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
