            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim. And passing towards the north, they said to Jephte: When thou wentest to fight against the children of Ammon, why wouldst thou not call us, that we might go with thee? Therefore we will burn thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when I saw this, I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them into my hands. What have I deserved, that you should rise up to fight against me?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then calling to him all the men of Galaad, he fought against Ephraim: and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim, because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim, and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Galaadites secured the fords of the Jordan, by which Ephraim was to return. And when any one of the number of Ephraim came thither in the flight, and said: I beseech you let me pass: the Galaadites said to him: Art thou not an Ephraimite? If he said: I am not:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> They asked him: Say then, Scibboleth, which is interpreted, An ear of corn. But he answered, Sibboleth, not being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Jephte the Galaadite judged Israel six years: and he died, and was buried in his city of Galaad.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> After him Abesan of Bethlehem judged Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> He had thirty sons, and as many daughters, whom he sent abroad, and gave to husbands, and took wives for his sons of the same number, bringing them into his house. And he judged Israel seven years:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he died, and was buried in Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To him succeeded Ahialon a Zahnlonite: and he judged Israel ten years:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he died, and was buried in ZahnIon.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> After him Abdon, the son of Illel, a Pharathonite, judged Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he had forty sons, and of them thirty grandsons, mounted upon seventy ass colts, and he judged Israel eight years:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he died, and was buried in Pharathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of Amalech.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.</p>
