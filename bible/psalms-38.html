            <p data-verse="38:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thy arrows are fastened in me : and thy hand hath been strong upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath : there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For my iniquities are gone over my head : and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end : I walked sorrowful all the day long.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in my flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly : I roared with the groaning of my heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hidden from thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of my eyes itself is not with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against me. And they that were near me stood afar off :</p>
            <p data-verse="38:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But I, as a deaf man, heard not : and as a dumb man not opening his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And I became as a man that heareth not : and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped : thou wilt hear me, O Lord my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me : and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For I am ready for scourges : and my sorrow is continually before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I will declare my inequity : and I will think for my sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But my enemies live, and are stronger that I : and they hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I followed goodness.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Forsake me not, O Lord my God : do not thou depart from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation.</p>
