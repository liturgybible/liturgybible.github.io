            <p data-verse="63:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra, this beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength. I, that speak justice, and am a defender to save.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the winepress?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me: I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the day of vengeance is in my heart, the year of my redemption is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I looked about, and there was none to help: I sought, and there was none to give aid: and my own arm hath saved for me, and my indignation itself hath helped me.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I have trodden down the people in my wrath, and have made them drunk in my indignation, and have brought down their strength to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I will remember the tender mercies of the Lord, the praise of the Lord for all the things that the Lord hath bestowed upon us, and for the multitude of his good things to the house of Israel, which he hath given them according to his kindness, and according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he said: Surely they are my people, children that will not deny: so he became their saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In all their affliction he was not troubled, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love, and in his mercy he redeemed them, and he carried them and lifted them up all the days of old.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But they provoked to wrath, and afflicted the spirit of his Holy One: and he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he remembered the days of old of Moses, and of his people: Where is he that brought them up out of the sea, with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put in the midst of them the spirit of his Holy One?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that brought out Moses by the right hand, by the arm of his majesty: that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that led them out through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness that stumbleth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As a beast that goeth down in the field, the spirit of the Lord was their leader: so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Look down from heaven, and behold from thy holy habitation and the place of thy glory: where is thy zeal, and thy strength, the multitude of thy bowels, and of thy mercies? they have held back themselves from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For thou art our father, and Abraham hath not known us, and Israel hath been ignorant of us: thou, O Lord, art our father, our redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Why hast thou made us to err, O Lord, from thy ways: why hast thou hardened our heart, that we should not fear thee? return for the sake of thy servants, the tribes of thy inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> They have possessed thy holy people as nothing: our enemies have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> We are become as in the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and when we were not called by thy name.</p>

            <p data-verse="63:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?</p>
            <p data-verse="63:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="63:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.</p>
