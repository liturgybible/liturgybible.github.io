            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Arise, and go to Ninive the great city: and preach in it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, according to the word of the Lord: now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jonas began to enter into the city one day's journey: and he cried, and said: Yet forty days, and Ninive shall be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the men of Ninive believed in God: and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the word came to the king of Ninive; and he rose up out of his throne, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive from the mouth of the king and of his princes, saying: Let neither men nor beasts, oxen nor sheep, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the Lord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive: and will turn away from his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And God saw their works, that they were turned from their evil way: and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that he would do to them, and he did it not.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>
