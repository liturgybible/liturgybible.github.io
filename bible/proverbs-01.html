            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To know wisdom, and instruction:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To understand the words of prudence: and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:</p>

            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> A wise man shall hear and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth, shall possess governments.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He shall understand a parable, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>

            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>
