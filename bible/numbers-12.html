            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his wife the Ethiopian,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only? hath he not also spoken to us in like manner? And when the Lord heard this,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> (For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary: Come out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when they were come out,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when they were come,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But it is not so with my servant Moses a who is most faithful in all my house:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And being angry with them he went away:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with leprosy,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O God, I beseech thee heal her.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and after wards she shall be called again.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days : and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother’s womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.</p>
