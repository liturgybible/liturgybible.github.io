            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.</p>
