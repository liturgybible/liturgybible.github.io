            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In three things I was beautified, and stood up beautiful both before God and men: the unity of brethren, the love of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Three sorts of men my soul hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poor man that is proud, a rich man that is a liar, and an old adulterer that doateth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou find any thing in thine age?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> O how comely a thing is judgment for gray hairs, and for ancient men to know counsel!</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> O how comely is the wisdom of old men, and understanding and counsel to men of honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> There be nine things which I have judged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will utter with my tongue: A man that hath joy of his children; and he that liveth to see the fall of his enemy:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the ears of them that will hear:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> O how great is he that findeth wisdom! yet is there none above him that feareth the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But the love of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of his love: and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Give me any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> There is no head above the head of a serpent; and there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, than to keep house with a wicked woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The wickedness of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackcloth.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Her husband shall sit among his neighbours; and when he heareth it shall sigh bitterly.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall upon her.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As the climbing up a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Stumble not at the beauty of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A woman, if she maintain her husband, is full of anger, impudence, and much reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Give the water no passage; neither a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh, and give her a bill of divorce, and let her go.</p>
