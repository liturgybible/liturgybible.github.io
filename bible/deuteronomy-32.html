            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: give ye magnificence to our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments: God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They have sinned against him, and are nose of his children in their filth: they are a wicked and perverse generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange god with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he said to them : Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was gathered to his people:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For the LORD’S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>
