            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Jesus answered: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wonder not, that I said to thee, you must be born again.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh, and whither he goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things be done?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus answered, and said to him: Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Amen, amen I say to thee, that we speak what we know, and we testify what we have seen, and you receive not our testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not; how will you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may have life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, because they are done in God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judea: and there he abode with them, and baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim; because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews concerning purification:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>
