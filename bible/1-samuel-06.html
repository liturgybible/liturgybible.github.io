            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the ark of God was in the land of the Philistines seven months.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? tell us how we are to send it back to its place? And they said:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If you send back the ark of the God of Israel, send it not away empty, but render unto him what you owe for sin, and then you shall be healed: and you shall know why his hand departeth not from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They answered: What is it we ought to render unto him for sin? and they answered:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> According to the number of the provinces of the Philistines you shall make five golden emerods, and five golden mice: for the same plague hath been upon you all, and upon your lords. And you shall make the likeness of your emerods, and the likeness of the mice that have destroyed the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel: to see if he will take off his hand from you, and from your gods, and from your land.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Why do you harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharao hardened their hearts? did not he, after he was struck, then let them go, and they departed?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore take and make a new cart: and two kine that have calved, on which there hath come no yoke, tie to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And you shall take the ark of the Lord, and lay it on the cart, and the vessels of gold, which you have paid him for sin, you shall put into a little box, at the side thereof: and send it away that it may go.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And you shall look: and if it go up by the way of his own coasts towards Bethsames, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, we shall know that it is not his hand hath touched us, but it hath happened by chance.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They did therefore in this manner: and taking two kine, that had suckling calves, they yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they laid the ark of God upon the cart, and the little box that had in it the golden mice and the likeness of the emerods.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the kine took the straight way that leadeth to Bethsames, and they went along the way, lowing as they went: and turned not aside neither to the right hand nor to the left: and the lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the borders of Bethsames.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now the Bethsamites were reaping wheat in the valley: and lifting up their eyes they saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the cart came into the field of Josue a Bethsamite, and stood there. And there was a great stone, and they cut in pieces the wood of the cart, and laid the kine upon it a holocaust to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Levites took down the ark of God, and the little box that was at the side of it, wherein were the vessels of gold, and they put them upon the great stone. The men also of Bethsames offered holocausts and sacrificed victims that day to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the five princes of the Philistines saw, and they returned to Accaron the same day.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And these are the golden emerods, which the Philistines returned for sin to the Lord: For Azotus one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for Geth one, for Accaron one:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the golden mice according to the number of the cities of the Philistines, of the five provinces, from the fenced city to the village that was without wall, and to the great Abel (the stone) whereon they set down the ark of the Lord, which was till that day in the field of Josue the Bethsamite.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But he slew of the men of Bethsames, because they had seen the ark of the Lord: and he slew of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand of the common people. And the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten the people with a great slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the men of Bethsames said: Who shall be able to stand before the Lord this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim, saying: The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord, come ye down and fetch it up to you.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.</p>
