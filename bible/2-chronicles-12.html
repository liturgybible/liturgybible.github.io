            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the kingdom of Roboam was strengthened and fortified, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem (because they had sinned against the Lord)</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt, to wit, Libyans, and Troglodites, and Ethiopians.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he took the strongest cities in Juda, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Semeias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the princes of Juda, that were gathered together in Jerusalem, fleeing from Sesac, and he said to them : Thus saith the Lord: You have left me, and I have left you in the hand of Sesac.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the princes of Israel, and the king, being in a consternation, said: The Lord is just.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when the Lord saw that they were humbled, the word of the Lord came to Semeias, saying: Because they are humbled, I will not destroy them, and I will give them a little help, and my wrath shall not fall upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sesac.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But yet they shall serve him, that they may know the difference between my service, and the service of a kingdom of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Sesac king of Egypt departed from Jerusalem, taking away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and he took all with him, and the golden shields that Solomon had made,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Instead of which the king made brazen ones, and delivered them to the captains of the shieldbearers, who guarded the entrance of the palace.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the shieldbearers came and took them, and brought them back again to their armoury.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But yet because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord turned away from them, and they were not utterly destroyed: for even in Juda there were found good works.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> King Roboam therefore was strengthened in Jerusalem, and reigned: he was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to establish his name there: and the name of his mother was Naama an Ammonitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But he did evil, and did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now the acts of Roboam first and last are written in the books of Semeias the prophet, and of Addo the seer, and diligently recorded: and there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all their days.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abia his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
