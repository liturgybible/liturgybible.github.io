            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For by this the ancients obtained a testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> By faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God; that from invisible things visible things might be made.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice exceeding that of Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was just, God giving testimony to his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> By faith Henoch was translated, that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had testimony that he pleased God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But without faith it is impossible to please God. For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and is a rewarder to them that seek him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> By faith Noe, having received an answer concerning those things which as yet were not seen, moved with fear, framed the ark for the saving of his house, by the which he condemned the world; and was instituted heir of the justice which is by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> By faith he that is called Abraham, obeyed to go out into a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> By faith he abode in the land, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, the co-heirs of the same promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he looked for a city that hath foundations; whose builder and maker is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> By faith also Sara herself, being barren, received strength to conceive seed, even past the time of age; because she believed that he was faithful who had promised,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For which cause there sprung even from one (and him as good as dead) as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> All these died according to faith, not having received the promises, but beholding them afar off, and saluting them, and confessing that they are pilgrims and strangers on the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For they that say these things, do signify that they seek a country. 15 And truly if they had been mindful of that from whence they came out, they had doubtless time to return.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But now they desire a better, that is to say, a heavenly country. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered Isaac: and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> (To whom it was said: In Isaac shall thy seed be called.)</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Accounting that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Whereupon also he received him for a parable.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> By faith also of things to come, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> By faith Jacob dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and adored the top of his rod.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the going out of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents; because they saw he was a comely babe, and they feared not the king's edict.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> By faith Moses, when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of Pharao's daughter;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Rather choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, than to have the pleasure of sin for a time,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians. For he looked unto the reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the fierceness of the king: for he endured as seeing him that is invisible.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> By faith he celebrated the pasch, and the shedding of the blood; that he, who destroyed the firstborn, might not touch them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> By faith they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians attempting, were swallowed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, by the going round them seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> By faith Rahab the harlot perished not with the unbelievers, receiving the spies with peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And what shall I yet say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, Barac, Samson, Jephthe, David, Samuel, and the prophets:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Who by faith conquered kingdoms, wrought justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered strength from weakness, became valiant in battle, put to flight the armies of foreigners:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Women received their dead raised to life again. But others were racked, not accepting deliverance, that they might find a better resurrection.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And others had trial of mockeries and stripes, moreover also of bands and prisons.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> They were stoned, they were cut asunder, they were tempted, they were put to death by the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Of whom the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, in mountains, and in dens, and in caved of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And all these being approved by the testimony of faith, received not the promise;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> God providing some better thing for us, that they should not be perfected without us.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>
