            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of the air: yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered together.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But yet let not any man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for thy people are as they that contradict the priest.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And thou shalt fall to day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I have made thy mother to be silent.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> My people have been silent, because they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> According to the multitude of them so have they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They shall eat the sins of my people, and shall lift up their souls to their iniquity.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there shall be like people like priest: and I will visit their ways upon them, and I will repay them their devices.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have committed fornication, and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing his law.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness take away the understanding.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My people have consulted their stocks, and their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornication hath deceived them, and they have committed fornication against their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They offered sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burnt incense upon the hills: under the oak, and the poplar, and the turpentine tree, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters commit fornication, and your spouses shall be adulteresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I will not visit upon your daughters when they shell commit fornication, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: because themselves conversed with harlots, and offered sacrifice with the effeminate, and the people that doth not understand shall be beaten.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If thou play the harlot, O Israel, at least let not Juda offend: and go ye not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven, and do not swear: The Lord liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Israel hath gone astray like a wanton heifer: now will the Lord feed them, as a lamb in a spacious place.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Ephraim is a partaker with idols, let him alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their banquet is separated, they have gone astray by fornication: they that should have protected them have loved to bring shame upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The wind hath bound them up in its wings, and they shall be confounded because of their sacrifices.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</p>
