            <p data-verse="38:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Honour a physician with the honour due unto him for the uses which ye may have of him: for the Lord hath created him.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For of the most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honour of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The skill of the physician shall lift up his head: and in the sight of great men he shall be in admiration.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the virtue thereof might be known?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he hath given men skill, that he might be honoured in his marvellous works.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> With such doth he heal men, and taketh away their pains.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Of such doth the apothecary make a confection; and of his works there is no end; and from him is peace over all the earth,</p>
            <p data-verse="38:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> My son, in thy sickness be not negligent: but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour; and make a fat offering, as not being.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> There is a time when in their hands there is good success.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For they shall also pray unto the Lord, that he would prosper that, which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> My son, let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the custom, and neglect not his burial.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Weep bitterly, and make great moan, and use lamentation, as he is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken of: and then comfort thyself for thy heaviness.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For of heaviness cometh death, and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poor is the curse of the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Take no heaviness to heart: drive it away, and member the last end.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Forget it not, for there is no turning again: thou shalt not do him good, but hurt thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest; and be comforted for him, when his Spirit is departed from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure: and he that hath little business shall become wise.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talk is of bullocks?</p>
            <p data-verse="38:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He giveth his mind to make furrows; and is diligent to give the kine fodder.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So every carpenter and workmaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and grave seals, and are diligent to make great variety, and give themselves to counterfeit imagery, and watch to finish a work:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> The smith also sitting by the anvil, and considering the iron work, the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer and the anvil is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still upon the pattern of the thing that he maketh; he setteth his mind to finish his work, and watcheth to polish it perfectly:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> So doth the potter sitting at his work, and turning the wheel about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his work, and maketh all his work by number;</p>
            <p data-verse="38:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his strength before his feet; he applieth himself to lead it over; and he is diligent to make clean the furnace:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> All these trust to their hands: and every one is wise in his work.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Without these cannot a city be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor go up and down:</p>
            <p data-verse="38:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> They shall not be sought for in publick counsel, nor sit high in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judges’ seat, nor understand the sentence of judgment: they cannot declare justice and judgment; and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="38:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But they will maintain the state of the world, and all their desire is in the work of their craft.</p>
