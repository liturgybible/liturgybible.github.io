            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> But they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather, because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions, blasphemies, evil suspicions,</p>
