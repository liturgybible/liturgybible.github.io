            <p data-verse="33:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now thou has said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words :</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am clean, and without sin : I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified : I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?</p>
            <p data-verse="33:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds :</p>
            <p data-verse="33:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Rescuing his soul from corruption : and his life from passing to the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man's uprightness,</p>
            <p data-verse="33:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall have mercy on him, and shall say : Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption : I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> His flesh is consumed with punishment, let him return to the days of his youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him : and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He shall look upon men, and shall say : I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Attend, Job, and hearken to me : and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak : for I would have thee to appear just.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And if thou have not, hear me : hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>

            <p data-verse="33:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="33:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>
            <p data-verse="33:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
            <p data-verse="33:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
            <p data-verse="33:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>
            <p data-verse="33:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>
            <p data-verse="33:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>
            <p data-verse="33:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="33:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
