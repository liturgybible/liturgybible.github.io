            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife of his own kindred.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a goodly child hid him three months.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be done.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</p>
