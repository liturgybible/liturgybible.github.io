            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up early and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of Madian was in the valley on the north side of the high hill.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people that are with thee are many, and Madian shall not be delivered into their hands: lest Israel should glory against me, and say: I was delivered by my own strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all, I Whosoever is fearful and timorous, let him return. So two and twenty thousand men went away from mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand remained.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people are still too many, bring them to the waters, and there I will try them: and of whom I shall say to thee, This shall go with thee, let him go: whom I shall forbid to go, let him return.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when the people were come down to the waters, the Lord said to Gedeon: They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the number of them that had lapped water, casting it with the hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: and all the rest of the multitude had drunk kneeling.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord said to Gedeon: By the three hundred men, that lapped water, I will save you, and deliver Madian into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number, he ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents: and he with the three hundred gave himself to the battle. Now the camp of Madian was beneath him in the valley.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> The same night the Lord said to him: Arise, and go down into the camp: because I have delivered them into thy hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara thy servant go down with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more secure to the enemies' camp. And he went down with Phara his servant into part of the camp, where was the watch of men in arms.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But Madian and Amalec, and all the eastern people lay scattered in the valley, as a multitude of locusts: their camels also were innumerable as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when Gedeon was come, one told his neighbour a dream: and in this manner related what he had seen: I dreamt a dream, and it seemed to me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the camp of Madian: and when it was come to a tent it struck it, and beat it down flat to the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else but the sword of Gedeon the son of Joas a man of Israel. For the Lord hath delivered Madian, and all their camp into his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when Gedeon had heard the dream, and the interpretation thereof, he adored: and returned to the camp of Israel, and said: Arise, for the Lord hath delivered the camp of Madian into our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he divided the three hundred men into three parts, and gave them trumpets in their hands, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also blow the trumpets on every side of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Gedeon, and the three hundred men that were with him, went into part of the camp, at the beginning of the midnight watch, and the watchmen being alarmed, they began to sound their trumpets, and to clap the pitchers one against another.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew, and they cried out: The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Standing every man in his place round about the enemies' camp. So all the camp was troubled, and crying out and howling they fled away.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted sounding the trumpets. And the Lord sent the sword into all the camp, and they killed one another,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the border of Abelmahula in Tebbath. But the men of Israel shouting from Nephtali and Aser, and from all Manasses pursued after Madian.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying: Come down to meet Madian, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and the Jordan. And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as Bethbera.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And having taken two men of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: Oreb they slew in the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of Zeb. And they pursued Madian, carrying the heads of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon beyond the waters of the Jordan.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.</p>
