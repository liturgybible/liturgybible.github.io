            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Solomon had made an end of his prayer, Are came down from heaven, and consumed the holocausts and the victims: and the majesty of the Lord tilled the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Neither could the priests enter into the temple of the Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Moreover all the children of Israel saw the fire coming down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house: and falling down with their faces to the ground, upon the stone pavement, they adored and praised the Lord: because he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king and all the people sacrificed victims before the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand rams: and the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the priests stood in their offices: and the Levites with the instruments of music of the Lord, which king David made to praise the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever, singing the hymns of David by their ministry: and the priests sounded with trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Solomon also sanctified the middle of the court before the temple of the Lord: for he offered there the holocausts, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar, which he had made, could not hold the holocausts and the sacrifices and the fat:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Solomon kept the solemnity at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Emath to the torrent of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he made on the eighth day a solemn assembly, because he had kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and had celebrated the solemnity seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent away the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad for the good that the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to all Israel his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all that he had designed in his heart to do, in the house of the Lord, and in his own house, and he prospered.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord appeared to him by night, and said : I have heard thy prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If I shut up heaven, and there fall no rain, or if I give orders, and command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And my people, upon whom my name is called, being converted, shall make supplication to me, and seek out my face, and do penance for their most wicked ways: then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sine and will heal their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> My eyes also shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer of him that shall pray in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I have chosen, and have sanctified this place, that my name may be there for ever, and my eyes and my heart may remain there perpetually.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And as for thee, if thou walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and keep my justices and my judgments :</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I will raise up the throne of thy kingdom, as I promised to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man of thy stock to be ruler in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But if you turn away, and forsake my justices, and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve strange gods, and adore them,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> I will pluck you up by the root out of my land which I have given you: and this house which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast away from before my face, and will make it a byword, and an example among all nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And this house shall be for a proverb to all that pass by, and they shall be astonished and say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on strange gods, and adored them, and worshipped them: therefore all these evils are come upon them.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’S house.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.</p>
