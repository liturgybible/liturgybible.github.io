            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the enemies of Juda and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to the Lord the God of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they came to Zorobabel, and the chief of the fathers, and said to them: Let us build with you, for we seek your God as ye do: behold we have sacrificed to him, since the days of Asor Haddan king of Assyria, who brought us hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said to them: You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus king of the Persians hath commanded us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of Juda, and troubled them in building.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their design all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the reign of Assuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And in the days of Artaxerxes, Beselam, Mithridates, and Thabeel, and the rest that were in the council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians : and the letter of accusation was written in Syriac, and was read in the Syrian tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe wrote a letter from Jerusalem to king Artaxerxes, in this manner:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe and the rest of their counsellors, the Dinites, and the Apharsathacites, the Therphalites, the Apharsites, the Erchuites, the Babylonians, the Susanechites, the Dievites, and the Elamites,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the rest of the nations, whom the great and glorious Asenaphar brought over: and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the countries of this side of the river in peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> (This is the copy of the letter, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the king, thy servants, the men that are on this side of the river, send greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be it known to the king, that the Jews, who came up from thee to us, are come to Jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, setting up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues, and this loss will fail upon the kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and thou shalt find written in the records: and shalt know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were raised therein of old time: for which cause also the city was destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired, thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the scribe, and to the rest that were in their council, inhabitants of Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, sending greeting and peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I commanded: and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been raised therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For there have been powerful kings in Jerusalem, who hare had dominion over all the country that is beyond the river: and have received tribute, and toll and revenues.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Now therefore hear the sentence: Hinder those men, that this city be not built, till further orders be given by me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> See that you be not negligent in executing this, lest by little and little the evil grow to the hurt of the kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now the copy of the edict of king Artaxerxes was read before Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe, and their counsellors: and they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and hindered them with arm and power.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then the work of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem was interrupted, and ceased till the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now because we have maintenance from the king’s palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>
