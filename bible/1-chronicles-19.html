            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned is his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son of Naas: for his father did a favour to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice, that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and spy out thy land.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and cut away their garments from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then to return.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of Soba.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together out of their cities, and came to battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of valiant men:</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Ammon came out and put their army in array before the gate of the city : and the kings, that were come to their aid, stood apart in the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all Israel, and marched against the Syrians,</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, I will help thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the Lord will do that which is good in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Joab and the people that were with him, went against the Syrians to the battle : and he put them to flight.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of Adarezer, was their leader.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it was told David, and he gathered together all Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his army in array against them, and they fought with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him: and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any more.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="19:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>
            <p data-verse="19:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</p>
            <p data-verse="19:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</p>
