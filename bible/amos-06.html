            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion, and to you that have confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the people, that go in with state into the house of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into Emath the great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> You that are separated unto the evil day: and that approach to the throne of iniquity;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your couches: that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the herd;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> You that sing to the sound of the psaltery: they have thought themselves to have instruments of music like David;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken away.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul, saith the Lord the God of hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his houses, and I will deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And if there remain ten men in one house, they also shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And a man's kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn him, that he may carry the bones out of the house; and he shall say to him that is in the inner rooms of the house: Is there yet any with thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall any to him: Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have we not taken unto us horns by our own strength?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</p>
