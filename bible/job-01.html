            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou ? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain ?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth ?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</p>
