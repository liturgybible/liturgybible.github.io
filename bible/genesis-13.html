            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he returned by the way that he came, from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> In the place of the altar which he had made before; and there he called upon the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Lot, lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan; and Lot abode in the towns that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord, beyond measure.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be able to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy seed also.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Arise and walk through the land in the length, and in the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> So Abram removing his tent came and dwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron: and he built there an altar to the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.</p>
