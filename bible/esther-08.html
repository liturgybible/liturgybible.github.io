            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews' enemy, to queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him that he was her uncle.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai. And Esther set Mardochai over her house.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And not content with these things, she fell down at the king's feet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give orders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices which he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And said: If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that the former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which he commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king's provinces, may be reversed by new letters.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For how call I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have given Aman's house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king's name, and were sealed with his ring.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king's edict was hung up in Susan.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king's presence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced and was glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But to the Jews a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king's commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and keeping holy day: insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews’ enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king’s provinces:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring: for the writing which is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may no man reverse.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then were the king’s scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus’ name, and sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.</p>
