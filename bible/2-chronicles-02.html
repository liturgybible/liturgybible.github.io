            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon determined to build a house to the name of the Lord, and a palace for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to over- see them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He sent also to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with David my father, and didst send him cedars, to build him a house, in which he dwelt:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So do with me that I may build a house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to burn incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth of bread, and for the holocausts, morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the Lord our God for ever, which are commanded for Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great above all gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: who am I that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only, that incense may be burnt before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Send me therefore a skilful man, that knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in scarlet and in blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the artificers, which I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Send me also cedars, and fir trees, and pine trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I desire to build, is to be exceeding great, and glorious.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Hiram king of Tyre sent a letter to Solomon, saying: Because the Lord hath loved his people, therefore he hath made thee king over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who hath given to king David a wise and knowing son, endued with understanding and prudence, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I therefore have sent thee my father Hiram, a wise and most skilful man,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in purple also, and violet, and silk and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord David thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The wheat therefore, and the barley and the oil, and the wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And we will cut down as many trees out of Libanus, as thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to Joppe: and it will be thy part to bring them thence to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Solomon numbered all the proselytes in the land of Israel, after the numbering which David his father had made, and they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on their shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains: and three thousand and six hundred to be overseers of the work of the people.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Joppa; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</p>
