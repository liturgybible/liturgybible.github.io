            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker)</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> He asked them, saying: Why is your oountenance sadder to day than usual?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Both not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed. g The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</p>

            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes :</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shah present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:</p>

            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For I was stolen away out of the land I of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I bed three baskets of meal upon my heed:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> After which Pharao will take thy hand from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a. great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the ward of his lord’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>
