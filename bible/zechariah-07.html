            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Casleu.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with him, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the prophets, saying: Must I weep in the fifth month, or must I sanctify myself as I have now done for many years?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: When you fasted, and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years: did you keep a fast unto me?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem as yet was inhabited, and was wealthy, both itself and the cities round about it, and there were inhabitants towards the south, and in the plain?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge ye true judgment, and shew ye mercy and compassion every man to his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And oppress not the widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger, and the poor: and let not a man devise evil in his heart against his brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But they would not hearken, and they turned away the shoulder to depart: and they stopped their ears, not to hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: so a great indignation came from the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass that as he spoke, and they heard not: so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms, which they know not: and the land was left desolate behind them, so that no man passed through or returned: and they changed the delightful land into a wilderness.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p>
