            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David said: Is there any one, think you, left of the house of Saul, that I may shew kindness to him for Jonathan's sake?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now there was of the house of Saul, a servant named Siba: and when the king had called him to him, he said to him: Art thou Siba? And he answered: I am Siba thy servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said: Is there any one left of the house of Saul, that I may shew the mercy of God unto him? And Siba said to the king: There is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Where is he? said he. And Siba said to the king: Behold he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodabar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodabar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come to David, he fell on his face and worshipped. And David said: Miphiboseth? And he answered: Behold thy servant.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David said to him: Fear not, for I will surely shew thee mercy for Jonathan thy father's sake, and I will restore the lands of Saul thy father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table always.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He bowed down to him, and said: Who am I thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then the king called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him: All that belonged to Saul, and all his house, I have given to thy master's son.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him: and thou shalt bring in food for thy master's son, that he may be maintained: and Miphiboseth the son of thy master shall always eat bread at my table. And Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Siba said to the king: As thou my lord the king hast commanded thy servant, so will thy servant do: and Miphiboseth shall eat at my table, as one of the sons of the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Miphiboseth had a young son whose name was Micha: and all the kindred of the house of Siba served Miphiboseth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But Miphiboseth dwelt in Jerusalem: because he ate always of the king's table: and he was lame of both feet.</p>

            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.</p>
