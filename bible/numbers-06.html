            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When a man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and will consecrate themselves to the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that may make a man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape: nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow: they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the raisin even to the kernel.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head, until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord. He shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because the consecration of his God is upon his head.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But if any man die suddenly before him: the head of his consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it forthwith on the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh day.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for a holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the dead: and he shall sanctify his head that day :</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the former days be made void, because his sanctification was profaned.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This is the law of consecration. When the days which he had determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And shall offer his oblation to the Lord: one he lamb of a year old without blemish for a holocaust, and one awe lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a victim of peace offering,</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A basket also of unleavened bread, tempered with oil, and wafers without leaven anointed with oil, and the libations of each:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the priest shall present them before the Lord, and shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread, and the libations that are due by custom.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite, be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant: and he shall take his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head is shaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them in the sight of the Lord: and they being sanctified shall belong to the priest, as the breast, which was commanded to be separated, and the shoulder. After this the Nazarite may drink wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those things which his hand shall find, according to that which he had vowed in his mind, so shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you bless the children of Israel, and you shall say to them:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The Lord turn his countenance to thee, and give thee peace.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they shall invoke my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.</p>
