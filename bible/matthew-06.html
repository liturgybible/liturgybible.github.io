            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber, and having shut the door, pray to thy Father in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when you are praying, speak not much, as the heathens. For they think that in their much speaking they may be heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Be not you therefore like to them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you, before you ask him.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thus therefore shall you pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Give us this day our supersubstantial bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if you will forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offences.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if you will not forgive men, neither will your Father forgive you your offences.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when you fast, be not as the hypocrites, sad. For they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But thou, when thou fastest anoint thy head, and wash thy face;</p>
            <p data-verse="6:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> That thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father who is in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Lay not up to yourselves treasures on earth: where the rust, and moth consume, and where thieves break through and steal.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven: where neither the rust nor moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through, nor steal.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The light of thy body is thy eye. If thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be lightsome.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But if thy eye be evil thy whole body shall be darksome. If then the light that is in thee, be darkness: the darkness itself how great shall it be!</p>
            <p data-verse="6:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one, and love the other: or he will sustain the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than the meat: and the body more than the raiment?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap, nor gather into barns: and your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are not you of much more value than they?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And which of you by taking thought, can add to his stature by one cubit?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And for raiment why are you solicitous? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And if the grass of the field, which is to day, and to morrow is cast into the oven, God doth so clothe: how much more you, O ye of little faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Be not solicitous therefore, saying, What shall we eat: or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be clothed?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For after all these things do the heathens seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need of all these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Seek ye therefore first the kingdom of God, and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Be not therefore solicitous for to morrow; for the morrow will be solicitous for itself. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</p>

            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p>
            <p data-verse="6:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</p>

            <p data-verse="6:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>

            <p data-verse="6:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>
