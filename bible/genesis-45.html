            <p data-verse="45:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be present at their knowing one another.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians and all the house of Pharao heard. \</p>
            <p data-verse="45:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: is my father yet living? His brethren could no answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Egypt for your preservation.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor reaping.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have food to live.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whold house, and governor in all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt: come down to me, linger not.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, thy sheep, and thy gerds, and all things that thou hast.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of famine remaining,) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things that thou hast.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced him and wept: and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of them: after which they were emboldened to ,peak to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And it was heard, and the fame was abroad in the king's court: The brethren of Joseph are come: and Pharao with all his family was glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his brethren, saying : Load your beasts, and go into the land of Chanaan.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to me: and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt, for/ the carriage of their children and their wives: and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come with all speed:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And leave nothing of your house- hold stuff: for all the riches of Egypt shall be yours.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao's commandment: and provisions for the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver with Ave robes of the best:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Sending to his father as much money and raiment, adding besides ten he asses to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many she asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to them: Be not angry in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Chanaan to their father Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they told him, saying: Joseph thy son is living: and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe them.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing. And when he saw the wagons and all that he had sent his spirit revived,</p>
            <p data-verse="45:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he said: It is enough for me, if Joseph my son be yet living: Iwill go and see him before I die.</p>

            <p data-verse="45:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</p>
            <p data-verse="45:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,</p>
            <p data-verse="45:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="45:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</p>
            <p data-verse="45:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</p>
