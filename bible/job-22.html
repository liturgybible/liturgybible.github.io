            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Can man be compared with God, even though he were of perfect knowledge?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> What doth it profit God if thou be just? or what dost thou give him if thy way be unspotted?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Shall he reprove thee for fear, and come with thee into judgment:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And not for thy manifold wickedness, and thy infinite iniquities?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without cause, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast not given water to the weary, thou hast withdrawn bread from the hungry.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> In the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land, and being the most mighty thou holdest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless thou hast broken in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore art thou surrounded with snares, and sudden fear troubleth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And didst thou think that thou shouldst not see darkness, and that thou shouldst not be covered with the violence of overflowing waters?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Dost not thou think that God is higher than heaven, and is elevated above the height of the stars?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou sayst: What doth God know? and he judgeth as it were through a mist.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The clouds are his covert, and he doth not consider our things, and he walketh about the poles of heaven.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Who said to God: Depart from us: and looked upon the Almighty as if he could do nothing:</p>
            <p data-verse="22:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Whereas he had filled their houses with good things: whose way of thinking be far from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and the innocent shall laugh them to scorn.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He shall give for earth flint, and for flint torrents of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Almighty shall be against thy enemies, and silver shall be heaped together for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then shalt thou abound in delights in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt pay vows.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thou shalt decree a thing, and it I shall come to thee, and light shall shine in thy ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For he that hath been humbled, shall be in glory: and he that shall bow down his eyes, he shall be saved.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</p>

            <p data-verse="22:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>
            <p data-verse="22:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</p>

            <p data-verse="22:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p>
