            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But you that adhere to the Lord your Cad, are all alive until this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord my God hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh them, as our God is present to all our petitions.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies, and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day before your eyes?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully. Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying: Call together the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto heaven: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall possess.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude, or image of male or female,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of birds, that fly under heaven,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that abide in the waters under the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land, which he will give you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the Jordan: you shall pass, and possess the goodly land.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God, which he hath made with thee: and make to thyself a graven likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and being deceived, make to yourselves any similitude, committing evil before the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the Jordan, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein long, but the Lord will destroy you,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a few among the nations, to which the Lord shall lead you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And there you shah serve gods, that were framed with men's hands: wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him: yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> After all the things aforesaid shall and thee, in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God: he will not leave thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he swore to thy fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time from the day that God created man upon the earth, from one end of heaven to the other end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath been known at any time,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of the midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by fight, and a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before thy eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and there is no other besides him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach thee. And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them. And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great power,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> To destroy at thy coming very great nations, and stronger than thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a possession, as thou seest at this present day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and there is no other.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee: that it may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east side,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour unwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before, and that he might escape to some one of these cities:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains of the tribe of Ruben: and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad: and Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of Manasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> This is the law, that Moses set before the children of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments, which he spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of Phogor, in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon, whom Moses slew. And the children of Israel coming out of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of the two kings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto the see of the wilderness, and unto the foot of mount Phasga.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
            <p data-verse="4:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:</p>

            <p data-verse="4:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;</p>
