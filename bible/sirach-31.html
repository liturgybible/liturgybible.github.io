            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Watching for riches consumeth the flesh, and the care thereof driveth away sleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleep,</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together; and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The poor laboureth in his poor estate; and when he leaveth off, he is still needy.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He that loveth gold shall not be justified, and he that followeth corruption shall have enough thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Gold hath been the ruin of many, and their destruction was present.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> It is a stumblingblock unto them that sacrifice unto it, and every fool shall be taken therewith.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderful things hath he done among his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who hath been tried thereby, and found perfect? then let him glory. Who might offend, and hath not offended? or done evil, and hath not done it?</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His goods shall be established, and the congregation shall declare his alms.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If thou sit at a bountiful table, be not greedy upon it, and say not, There is much meat on it.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Remember that a wicked eye is an evil thing: and what is created more wicked than an eye? therefore it weepeth upon every occasion.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Stretch not thine hand whithersoever it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Judge not thy neighbour by thyself: and be discreet in every point.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Eat as it becometh a man, those things which are set before thee; and devour note, lest thou be hated.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Leave off first for manners’ sake; and be not unsatiable, lest thou offend.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> A very little is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short upon his bed.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Sound sleep cometh of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him: but the pain of watching, and choler, and pangs of the belly, are with an unsatiable man.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And if thou hast been forced to eat, arise, go forth, vomit, and thou shalt have rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> My son, hear me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt find as I told thee: in all thy works be quick, so shall there no sickness come unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Whoso is liberal of his meat, men shall speak well of him; and the report of his good housekeeping will be believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But against him that is a niggard of his meat the whole city shall murmur; and the testimonies of his niggardness shall not be doubted of.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Shew not thy valiantness in wine; for wine hath destroyed many.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> The furnace proveth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkeness.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheerfulness of the mind:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But wine drunken with excess maketh bitterness of the mind, with brawling and quarrelling.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Drunkenness increaseth the rage of a fool till he offend: it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: give him no despiteful words, and press not upon him with urging him to drink.</p>
