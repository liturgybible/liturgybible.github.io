            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which are ready to die. For I find not thy works full before my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received and heard: and observe, and do penance. If then thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments: and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He that shall overcome, shall thus be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come and adore before thy feet. And they shall know that I have loved thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will also keep thee from the hour of the temptation, which shall come upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; and he shall go out no more; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire tried, that thou mayest be made rich; and mayest be clothed in white garments, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thy eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous therefore, and do penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Behold, I stand at the gate, and knock. If any man shall hear my voice, and open to me the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with me in my throne: as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</p>
