            <p data-verse="21:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Every way of a man seemeth right to himself: but the Lord weigheth the hearts.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> To do mercy and judgment, pleaseth the Lord more than victims.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Haughtiness of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart: the lamp of the wicked is sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The thoughts of the industrious al- ways bring forth abundance: but every sluggard is always in want.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He that gathereth treasures by a lying tongue, is vain and foolish, and shall stumble upon the snares of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> The robberies of the wicked shall be their downfall, because they would not do judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The perverse way of a man is strange: but as for him that is pure, his work is right.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling women, and in a common house.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The soul of the wicked desireth evil, he will not have pity on his neighbour.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> When a pestilent man is punished, the little one will be wiser: and if he follow the wise, he will receive knowledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The just considereth seriously the house of the wicked, that he may withdraw the wicked from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He that stoppeth his ear against the cry of the poor, shall also cry himself and shall not be heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> A secret present quencheth anger: and a gift in the bosom the greatest wrath.</p>

            <p data-verse="21:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> He longeth and desireth all the day : but he that is just, will give, and will not cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> The sacrifices of the wicked are abominable, because they are offered of wickedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> A lying witness shall perish: an obedient man shall speak of victory.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> The wicked man impudently hardeneth his face: but he that is righteous, correcteth his way.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> There is no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel against the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="21:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but the Lord giveth safety.</p>
