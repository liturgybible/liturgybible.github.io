            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Israel at that time abode in Settim, and the people committed fornication with the daughters of Moab,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who called them to their sacrifices. And they ate of them, and adored their gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Israel was initiated to Beelphegor: upon which the Lord being angry,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Said to Moses: Take all the princes of the people, and hang them up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury may be turned away from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses said to the judges of Israel: Let every man kill his neighbours, that have been initiated to Beelphegor.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And behold one of the children of Israel went in before his brethren to a harlot of Madian, in the sight of Moses, and of all the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it, he rose up from the midst; of the multitude, and taking a dagger,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Went in after the Israelite into the brothel house, and thrust both of them through together, to wit, the man and the woman in the genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And there were slain four and twenty thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Lord said to Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel: because he was moved with my zeal against them, that I myself might not destroy the children of Israel in my zeal.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore say to him: Behold I give him the peace of my covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him and his seed, because he hath been zealous for his God, and hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the name of the Israelite, was slain with the woman of Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince the kindred and tribe of Simeon.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Madianite woman, that was slain with him, was called Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince among the Madianites.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Let the Madianites find you enemies, and slay you them:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Because they also have acted like enemies against you, and have guilefully deceived you by the idol Phogor, and Cozbi their sister, a daughter of a prince of Madian, who was slain in the day the plague for the sacrilege of Phogor.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Vex the Midianites, and smite them:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.</p>
