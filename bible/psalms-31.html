            <p data-verse="31:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, Iet me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou best regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly:</p>
            <p data-verse="31:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly.</p>
            <p data-verse="31:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.</p>
