            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And king Antiochus the son of Demetrius sent letters from the isles of the sea to Simon the priest, and prince of the nation of the Jews, and to all the people:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the contents were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge the kingdom, and to restore it to its former estate: and I have chosen a great army, and have built ships of war.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I design to go through the country that I may take revenge of them that have destroyed our country, and that have made many cities desolate in my realm.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which all the kings before me remitted to thee, and what other gifts soever they remitted to thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I give thee leave to coin thy own money in thy country:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And let Jerusalem be holy and free, and all the armour that hath been made, and the fortresses which thou hast built, and which thou keepest in thy hands, let them remain to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And all that is due to the king, and what should be the king's hereafter, from this present and for ever, is forgiven thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when we shall have recovered our kingdom, we will glorify thee, and thy nation, and the temple with great glory, so that your glory shall be made manifest in all the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> In the year one hundred and seventy-four Antiochus entered into the land of this fathers, and all the forces assembled to him, so that few were left with Tryphon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And king Antiochus pursued after him, and he fled along by the sea coast and came to Dora.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For he perceived that evils were gathered together upon him, and his troops had forsaken him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Antiochus camped above Dora with a hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he invested the city, and the ships drew near by sea: and they annoyed the city by land, and by sea, and suffered none to come in, or to go out.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Numenius, and they that had been with him, came from the city of Rome, having letters written to the kings, and countries, the contents whereof were these:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lucius the consul of the Romans, to king Ptolemee, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The ambassadors of the Jews our friends came to us, to renew the former friendship and alliance, being sent from Simon the high priest, and the people of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they brought also a shield of gold of a thousand pounds.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> It hath seemed good therefore to us to write to the kings, and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries: and that they should give no aid to them that fight against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And it hath seemed good to us to received the shield of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If therefore any pestilent men are fled out of their country to you, deliver them to Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their law.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> These same things were written to king Demetrius, and to Attalus, and to Ariarathes, and to Arsaces,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And to all the countries; and to Lampsacus, and to the Spartans, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samus, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Alicarnassus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Rhodes, and Phaselis, and Gortyna, and Gnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon the high priest, and to the people of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time, assaulting it continually, and making engines: and shut up Tryphon, that he could not go out.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen men to aid him, silver also, and gold, and abundance of furniture.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that he had made with him before, and alienated himself from him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And he sent to him Athenobius one of his friends, to treat with him, saying: You hold Joppe, and Gazara, and the castle that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my kingdom:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havock in the land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Now therefore deliver up the cities that you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without the borders of Judea.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the havock that you have made, and the tributes of the cities other five hundred talents: or else we will come and fight against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem, and saw the glory of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great equipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king's words.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Simon answered him, and said to him: We have neither taken other men's land, neither do we hold that which is other men's: but the inheritance of our fathers, which was for some time unjustly possessed by our enemies.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But we having opportunity claim the inheritance of our fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara, they did great harm to the people, and to our country: yet for these we will give a hundred talents. And Athenobius answered him not a word:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these words, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the king was exceeding angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And the king appointed Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an army of footmen and horsemen.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea: and he commanded him to build up Gedor, and to fortify the gates of the city, and to war against the people. But the king himself pursued after Tryphon.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to ravage Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and to build Gedor.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he placed there horsemen, and an army: that they might issue forth, and make incursions upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in the strong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to set upon them on the sabbath day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with him said, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honour to that day, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured with holiness above all other days.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were a Mighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, and mighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and I command to take arms, and to do the king’s business. Yet he obtained not to have his wicked will done.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined to set up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and them that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord would help him:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the heathen against them, but to remember the help which in former times they had received from heaven, and now to expect the victory and aid, which should come unto them from the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, and withal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore, he made them more cheerful.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them their charge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen, and the breach of oaths.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence of shields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: and beside that, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as if it had been so indeed, which did not a little rejoice them.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been high priest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation, gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from a child in all points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed for the whole body of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> This done, in like manner there appeared a man with gray hairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful and excellent majesty.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit, Jeremias the prophet of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave to Judas a sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thou shalt wound the adversaries.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which were very good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encourage the hearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp, but courageously to set upon them, and manfully to try the matter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the care that they took for their wives, and their children, their brethren, and folks, was in least account with them: but the greatest and principal fear was for the holy temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Also they that were in the city took not the least care, being troubled for the conflict abroad.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and the enemies were already come near, and the army was set in array, and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set in wings,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretched out his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lord that worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as are worthy:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord, thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king of Judea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundred fourscore and five thousand:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angel before us for a fear and dread unto them;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And through the might of thine arm let those be stricken with terror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And he ended thus.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward with trumpets and songs.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But Judas and his company encountered the enemies with invocation and prayer.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they slew no less than thirty and five thousand men: for through the appearance of God they were greatly cheered.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, they knew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising the Almighty in their own language.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizens both in body and mind, and who continued his love toward his countrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor’s head, and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> So when he was there, and called them of his nation together, and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that were of the tower,</p>
            <p data-verse="15:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And shewed them vile Nicanor’s head, and the hand of that blasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out against the holy temple of the Almighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor, he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls, and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord, saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He hanged also Nicanor’s head upon the tower, an evident and manifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to let that day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is called Adar, the day before Mardocheus’ day.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth the Hebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make an end.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it is that which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and as wine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste: even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them that read the story. And here shall be an end.</p>
