            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Considering your chaste conversation with fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let him decline from evil, and do good: let him seek after peace and pursue it:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Whereunto baptism being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
