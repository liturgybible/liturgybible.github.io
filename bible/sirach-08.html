            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Strive not with a mighty man’ lest thou fall into his hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us wax old.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction, and how to serve great men with ease.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give answer as need requireth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Rise not up in anger at the presence of an injurious person, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for him according to his honour.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he become grievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will, and thou shalt perish with him through his folly.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help, he will overthrow thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.</p>
