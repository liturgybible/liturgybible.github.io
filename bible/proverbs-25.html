            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias king of Juda copied out.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The heaven above, and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest after- ward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> To trust to an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> It is better to sit m a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good tidings from a far country.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot, and a corrupted spring.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty, shall be overwhelmed by glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
