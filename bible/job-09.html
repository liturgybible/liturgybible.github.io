            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace ?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who commandeth tile sun and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars as it were under a seal:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart I shall not understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> God, whose wrath no mall can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> If I be washed as it were with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean :</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="9:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Job answered and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="9:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</p>
            <p data-verse="9:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</p>
            <p data-verse="9:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</p>
            <p data-verse="9:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</p>
            <p data-verse="9:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</p>
