            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have thee sons and daughters in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and daughters, that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them: and concerning their fathers, of whom they were born in this land:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They shall die by the death of grievous illnesses: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be buried, they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed with the sword, and with famine: and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thus saith the Lord: Enter not into the house of feasting, neither go thou to mourn, nor to comfort them: because I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the Lord, my mercy and commiserations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Both the great and the little shall die in the land: they shall not be buried nor lamented, and men shall not cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they shall not break bread among them to him that mourneth, to comfort him for the dead: neither shall they give them to drink of the cup, to comfort them for their father and mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And do not thou go into the house of feasting, to sit with them, and to eat and drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will take away out of this place in your sight, and in your days the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and they shall say to thee: Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced against us all this great evil? what is our iniquity? and what is our sin, that we have sinned against the Lord our God?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Thou shalt say to them: Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord: and went after strange gods, and served them, and adored them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And you also have done worse than your fathers: for behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil heart, so as not to hearken to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land which you know not, nor you fathers: and there you shall serve strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it shall be said no more: The Lord liveth, that brought for the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But, the Lord liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I gave to their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Behold I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, and their iniquity hath not been hid from my eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I will repay first their double iniquities, and their sins: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their idols, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> O Lord, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the day of tribulation: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth, and shall say: Surely our fathers have possessed lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Shall a man make gods unto himself, and there are no gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore, behold I will this once cause them to know, I will shew them my hand and my power: and they shall know that my name is the Lord.</p>

            <p data-verse="16:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="16:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</p>
            <p data-verse="16:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="16:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.</p>
            <p data-verse="16:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</p>
            <p data-verse="16:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.</p>
