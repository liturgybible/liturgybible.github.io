            <p data-verse="15:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> He that feareth the Lord will do good, and he that hath the knowledge of the law shall obtain her.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And as a mother shall she meet him, and receive him as a wife married of a virgin.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> With the bread of understanding shall she feed him, and give him the water of wisdom to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> He shall be stayed upon her, and shall not be moved; and shall rely upon her, and shall not be confounded.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> She shall exalt him above his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He shall find joy and a crown of gladness, and she shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> But foolish men shall not attain unto her, and sinners shall not see her.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For she is far from pride, and men that are liars cannot remember her.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For praise shall be uttered in wisdom, and the Lord will prosper it.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> The Lord hateth all abomination; and they that fear God love it not.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He himself made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel;</p>
            <p data-verse="15:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy hand unto whether thou wilt.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Before man is life and death; and whether him liketh shall be given him.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For the wisdom of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things:</p>
            <p data-verse="15:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And his eyes are upon them that fear him, and he knoweth every work of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="15:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin.</p>
