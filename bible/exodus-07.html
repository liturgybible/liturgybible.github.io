            <p data-verse="7:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I have appointed thee the God of Pharao: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee; and he shall speak to Pharao, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But I shall harden his heart, and shall multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he will not hear you: and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and will bring forth my army and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, by very great judgments.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, who have stretched forth my hand upon Egypt, and have brought forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: so did they.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When Pharao shall say to you, Shew signs: thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharao, and it shall be turned into a serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as the Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharao, and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians: and they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets did in like manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And they every one cast down their rods, and they were turned into serpents: but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Pharao's heart is hardened, he will not let the people go.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river: and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to thee saying: Let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert: and hitherto thou wouldst not hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus therefore saith the Lord: In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold I will strike with the rods that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the fishes that are in the river shall die, and the waters shall be corrupted, and the Egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink the water of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> The Lord also said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be turned into blood: and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: and lifting up the rod he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants: and it was turned into blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the fishes that were in the river died: and the river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in like manner: and Pharao's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he turned himself away and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to it this time also.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And seven days were fully ended, after that the Lord struck the river.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.</p>

            <p data-verse="7:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="7:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</p>
            <p data-verse="7:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</p>
