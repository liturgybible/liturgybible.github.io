            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Abraham married another wife, named Cetura:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Who bore to him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomin.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the days of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five years.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's servant, bore unto him:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the years of Ismael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the children struggled in her womb: and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother's foot in his hand, and therefore he was called Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when they were grown up, Esau became a skillful hunter, and a husbandman, but Jacob a plain man dwelt in tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jacob boiled Pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.</p>

            <p data-verse="25:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</p>
            <p data-verse="25:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
            <p data-verse="25:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:</p>
            <p data-verse="25:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>
            <p data-verse="25:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
            <p data-verse="25:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>
