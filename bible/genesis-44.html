            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way; Joseph sendingfor the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?\</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Them they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore two.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)</p>
            <p data-verse="44:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let me be tht proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</p>

            <p data-verse="44:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</p>
            <p data-verse="44:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>
            <p data-verse="44:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;</p>
            <p data-verse="44:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="44:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>
