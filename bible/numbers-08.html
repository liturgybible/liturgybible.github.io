            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him: When thou shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the south side. Give orders therefore that the lamps look over against the north, towards the table of the leaves of proposition, over against that part shall they give light, towards which the candlestick looketh.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of beaten gold, both the shaft in the middle, and all that came out of both sides of the branches: according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to Moses, so he made the candlestick.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying :</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and thou shalt purify them,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> According to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the water of purification, and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh. And when they shall have washed their garments, and are cleansed,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering thereof fine flour tempered with oil: and thou shalt take another ox of the herd for a sin offering:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the covenant, calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel shall put their hands upon them:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a gift in the sight of the Lord from the children of Israel, that they may serve in his ministry.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the oxen, of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin, and the other for a holocaust to the Lord, to pray for them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his sons, and shalt consecrate them being offered to the Lord,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, to be mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the covenant, to serve me. And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord: for as a gift they were given me by the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb in Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of men and of beasts, are mine. From the day that I slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, have I sanctified them to myself:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of the covenant, and to pray for them, lest there should be a plague among the people, if they should presume to approach unto my sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children of Israel did with the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they were purified, and washed their garments. And Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lard, and prayed for them,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the covenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons. As the Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> This is the law of the Levites: From twenty-five years old and upwards, they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their age, they shall cease to serve:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the tabernacle of the covenant, to keep the things that are committed to their care, but not to do the works. Thus shalt thou order the Levites touching their charge.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
