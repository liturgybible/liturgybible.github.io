            <p data-verse="12:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.</p>
