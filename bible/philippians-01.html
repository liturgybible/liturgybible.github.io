            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</p>

            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>

            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</p>
