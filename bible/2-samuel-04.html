            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands, the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Remmon a Berothite of the children of Benjamin: for Beroth also was reckoned in Benjamin.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there until that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jonathan the son of Saul bad a son that was lame of his feet: for he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan from Jezrahel. And his nurse took him up and fled: and as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame: and his name was Miphiboseth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and he was sleeping upon his bed at noon. And the doorkeeper of the house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For when they came into the house, be was sleeping upon his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him: and taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron: and they said to the king: Behold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy who sought thy life: and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The man that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought he brought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who should have been rewarded for his news.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your hand, and take you away from the earth?</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</p>
