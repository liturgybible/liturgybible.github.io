            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one's self unspotted from this world.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
