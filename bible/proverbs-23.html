            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul in thy own power.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly towards heaven.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Because like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt loose thy beautiful words.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let thy heart apply itself to instruction: and thy ears to words of knowledge.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink of their cups.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep, when the stern is lost.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake, and find wine again?</p>

            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches  certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
