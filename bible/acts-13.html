            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now there were in the church which was at Antioch, prophets and doctors, among whom was Barnabas, and Simon who was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manahen, who was the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And as they were ministering to the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost said to them: Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then they, fasting and praying, and imposing their hands upon them, sent them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So they being sent by the Holy Ghost, went to Seleucia: and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when they were come to Salamina, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also in the ministry.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when they had gone through the whole island, as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesu:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent man. He sending for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Elymas the magician (for so his name is interpreted) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Saul, otherwise Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, looking upon him,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Said: O full of all guile, and of all deceit, child of the devil, enemy of all justice, thou ceasest not to pervert the right ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately there fell a mist and darkness upon him, and going about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done, believed, admiring at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed from Paphos, they came to Perge in Pamphylia. And John departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But they passing through Perge, came to Antioch in Pisidia: and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day, they sat down.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Ye men, brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to make to the people, speak.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Paul rising up, and with his hand bespeaking silence, said: Ye men of Israel, and you that fear God, give ear.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought them out from thence,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And for the space of forty years endured their manners in the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And destroying seven nations in the land of Chanaan, divided their land among them, by lot,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> As it were, after four hundred and fifty years: and after these things, he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And after that they desired a king: and God gave them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when he had removed him, he raised them up David to be king: to whom giving testimony, he said: I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who shall do all my wills.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Of this man's seed God according to his promise, hath raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> John first preaching, before his coming, the baptism of penance to all the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when John was fulfilling his course, he said: I am not he, whom you think me to be: but behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you fear God, to you the word of this salvation is sent.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For they that inhabited Jerusalem, and the rulers thereof, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets, which are read every sabbath, judging him have fulfilled them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of Pilate, that they might kill him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in a sepulchre.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But God raised him up from the dead the third day:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Who was seen for many days, by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who to this present are his witnesses to the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And we declare unto you, that the promise which was made to our fathers,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> This same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising up Jesus, as in the second psalm also is written: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And to shew that he raised him up from the dead, not to return now any more to corruption, he said thus: I will give you the holy things of David faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And therefore, in another place also, he saith: Thou shalt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For David, when he had served in his generation, according to the will of God, slept: and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But he whom God hath raised from the dead, saw no corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is preached to you: and from all the things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> In him every one that believeth, is justified.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, if any man shall tell it you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And as they went out, they desired them, that on the next sabbath, they would speak unto them these words.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the Jews, and of the strangers who served God, followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> But the next sabbath day, the whole city almost came together, to hear the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with envy, and contradicted those things which were said by Paul, blaspheming.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly: To you it behoved us first to speak the word of God: but because you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold we turn to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> For so the Lord hath commanded us: I have set thee to be the light of the Gentiles; that thou mayest be for salvation unto the utmost part of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And the Gentiles hearing it, were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to life everlasting, believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And the word of the Lord was published throughout the whole country.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> But the Jews stirred up religious and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas: and cast them out of their coasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But God raised him from the dead:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
