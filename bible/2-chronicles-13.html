            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abia reigned over Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and his mother's name was Michaia, the daughter of Uriel of Gabaa: and there was war between Abia and Jeroboam.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And when Abia had begun battle, and had with him four hundred thou- sand most valiant and chosen men, Jeroboam put his army in array against him, eight hundred thousand men, who were also chosen and most valiant for war.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Abia stood upon mount Semeron, which was in Ephraim, and said: Hear me, O Jeroboam, and all Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave to David the kingdom over Israel for ever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up: m and rebelled against his lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there were gathered to him vain men, and children of Belial: and they prevailed against Roboam the son of Solomon: for Roboam was unexperienced, and of a fearful heart, and could not resist them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And now you say that you are able to withstand the kingdom of the Lord, which he possesseth by the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and golden calves, which Jeroboam hath made you for gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites: and you have made you priests, like all the nations of the earth: whosoever cometh and consecrateth his hand with a bullock of the herd, and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are no gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the Lord is our God, whom we forsake not, and the priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites are in their order.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they offer holocausts to the Lord, every day, morning and evening, and incense made according to the ordinance of the law, and the leaves are set forth on a most clean table, and there is with us the golden candlestick, and the lamps thereof, to be lighted always in the evening: for we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, whom you have forsaken.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore God is the leader in our army, and his priests who sound with trumpets, and resound against you: O children of Israel, fight not against the Lord the God of your fathers, for it is not good for you.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> While he spoke these things, Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind him. And while he stood facing the enemies, he encompassed Juda. who perceived it not, with his army.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Juda looked back, they saw the battle coming upon them both before and behind, and they cried to the Lord: and the priests began to sound with the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And all the men of Juda shouted: and behold when they shouted, God terrified Jeroboam, and all Israel that stood against Abia and Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord delivered them into their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter, and there fell wounded of Israel five hundred thousand valiant men.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the children of Israel were brought down, at that time, and the children of Juda were exceedingly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord the God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters, Ephron also and her daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jeroboam was not able to resist any more, in the days of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Abia, being strengthened in his kingdom, took fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and works, are written diligently in the book of Addo the prophet.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p>
