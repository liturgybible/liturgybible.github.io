            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the anger of the Lord was again kindled against Israel, and stirred up David among them, saying: Go, number Israel and Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the king said to Joab the general of his army: Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and number ye the people that I may know the number of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joab said to the king: The Lord thy God increase thy people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again multiply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king: but what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But the king's words prevailed over the words of Joab, and of the captains of the army: and Joab, and the captains of the soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when they had passed the Jordan, they came to Aroer to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of Gad.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of Dan. And going about by Sidon,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> They passed near the walls of Tyre, and all the land of the Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and they came to the south of Juda into Bersabee:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And having gone through the whole land, after nine months and twenty days, they came to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to the king, and there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword: and of Juda five hundred thousand fighting men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered: and David said to the Lord: I have sinned very much in what I have done: but I pray thee, O Lord, to take away the iniquity of thy servant, because I have done exceeding foolishly.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And David arose in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Go, and say to David: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt, that I may do it to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when Gad was come to David, he told him, saying: Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land: or thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy land. Now therefore deliberate, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said to Gad: I am in a great strait: but it is better that I should fall into the hands of the Lord (for his mercies are many) than into the hands of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning unto the time appointed, and there died of the people from Dan to Bersabee seventy thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when the angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction, and said to the angel that slew the people: It is enough: now hold thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people: It is I; I am he that have sinned, I have done wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Gad came to David that day, and said: Go up, and build an altar to the Lord in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And David went up according to the word of Gad which the Lord had commanded him.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> An going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face to the earth, and said: Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? Arid David said to him: To buy the thrashingfloor of thee, and build an altar to the Lord, that the plague, which rageth among the people, may cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Areuna said to David: Let my lord the king take, and offer, as it seemeth good to him: thou hast here oxen for a holocaust, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king: and Areuna said to the king: The Lord thy God receive thy vow.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king answered him, and said: Nay, but I will buy it of thee at a price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God holocausts free cost. So David bought the floor, and the oxen, for fifty sicles of silver:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered holocausts and peace offerings: and the Lord became merciful to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="24:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>
