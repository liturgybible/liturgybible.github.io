            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, gathering together against Aaron, said: Arise, make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has befallen him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Aaron said to them: Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings to Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders' work, and made of them a molten calf. And they said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying: To morrow is the solemnity of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And rising in the morning, they offered holocausts, and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat, and drink, and they rose up to play.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath sinned.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew them: and they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And again the Lord said to Moses: See that this people is stiffnecked:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why, O Lord, is thy indignation kindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to you seed, and you shall possess it for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And made by the work of God: the writing also of God was graven in the tables.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight, nor the shout of men compelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances: and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the mount:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strowed into water, and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he said to Aaron: What has this people done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended: for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They said to me: Make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is befallen him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and they took and brought it to me: and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies,)</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If any man be on the Lord's side let him join with me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his thigh: go, and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said: You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be given to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people: You have sinned a very great sin: I will go up to the Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And returning to the Lord, he said: I beseech thee: this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this trespass,</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the Lord answered him: He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee: my angel shall go before thee. And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> The Lord therefore struck the people for the guilt on occasion of the calf which Aaron had made.</p>

            <p data-verse="32:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
            <p data-verse="32:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?</p>
            <p data-verse="32:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)</p>
            <p data-verse="32:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD’S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="32:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</p>
