            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And saith to them: Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat: loose him, and bring him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And if any man shall say to you, What are you doing? say ye that the Lord hath need of him: and immediately he will let him come hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in the meeting of two ways: and they loose him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And some of them that stood there, said to them: What do you loosing the colt?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them; and they let him go with them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they brought the colt to Jesus; and they lay their garments on him, and he sat upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And they that went before and they that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple: and having viewed all things round about, when now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethania with the twelve.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the next day when they came out from Bethania, he was hungry.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And answering he said to it: May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his disciples heard it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they came to Jerusalem. And when he was entered into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the chairs of them that sold doves.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through the temple;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree, which thou didst curse, is withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Amen I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe, that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive; and they shall come unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any man; that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But if you will not forgive, neither will your Father that is in heaven, forgive you your sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they come again to Jerusalem. And when he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they say to him: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word, and answer you me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> If we say, From men, we fear the people. For all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And they answering, say to Jesus: We know not. And Jesus answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>
