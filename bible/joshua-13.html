            <p data-verse="13:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all Gessuri.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the borders of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the borders of the Amorrhite,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Emath.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I have commanded thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasses,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river Jordan, on the east side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far as Dibon:</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,</p>

            <p data-verse="13:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben according to their kindreds.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Balaam also the son of Beer the soothsayer, the children of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were slain.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> This is the possession of the children of Gad by their families, their cities, and villages.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his children possession according to their kindreds,</p>
            <p data-verse="13:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in Basan, threescore towns.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, to one? half of the children of Machir according to their kindreds.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east side.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke to them.</p>
