            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then Booz went up to the gate, and sat there. And when he had seen the kinsman going by, of whom he had spoken before, he said to him, calling him by his name: Turn aside for a little while, and sit down here. He turned aside, and sat down.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Booz taking ten men of the ancients of the city, said to them: Sit ye down here.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> They sat down, and he spoke to the kinsman: Noemi, who is returned from the country of Moab, will sell a parcel of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> I would have thee to understand this, and would tell thee before all that sit here, and before the ancients of my people. If thou wilt take possession of it by the right of kindred: buy it and possess it: but if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman's hand, thou must take also Ruth the Moabitess, who was the wife of the deceased: to raise up the name of thy kinsman in his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen, that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe, and gave it to his neighhour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took it off from his foot.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to the ancients and to all the people: You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And have taken to wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren and his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients answered: We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel: that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And that the house may be, as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore unto Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive and to bear a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor, that his name should be preserved in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Noemi taking the child laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the women her neighbours, congratulating with her and saying: There is a son born to Noemi: called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> These are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esron,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Esron begot Aram, Aram begot Aminadab,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Aminadab begot Nahasson, Nahasson begot Salmon,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Salmon begot Booz, Booz begot Obed,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Obed begot Isai, Isai begot David.</p>

            <p data-verse="4:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</p>
            <p data-verse="4:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="4:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</p>
            <p data-verse="4:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</p>
