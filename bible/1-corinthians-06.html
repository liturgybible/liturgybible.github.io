            <p data-verse="6:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren ?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</p>
            <p data-verse="6:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
            <p data-verse="6:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren.</p>
