            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And some of them believed, and were associated to Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason's house, sought to bring them out unto the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither also;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these things,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> (Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where do penance.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> So Paul went out from among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>

            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> So Paul departed from among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>
