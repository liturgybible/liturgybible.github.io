            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue. And when the Lord heard it he was angry. And the fire of the Lord being kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire was swallowed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he called the name of that place, The burning: for that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them, burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> A Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> and when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to eat? it was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there they buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD’S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!</p>
            <p data-verse="11:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</p>
