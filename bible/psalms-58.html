            <p data-verse="58:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a title.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> If in very deed you speak justice: judge right things, ye sons of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> For in your heart you work iniquity: your hands forge injustice in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray from the womb: they have spoken false things.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent: like the deaf asp that stoppeth her ears:</p>
            <p data-verse="58:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard that charmeth wisely.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth: the Lord shall break the grinders of the lions.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent his bow till they be weakened.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away: fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up, as alive, in his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And man shall say: If indeed there be fruit to the just: there is indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth.</p>

            <p data-verse="58:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p>
            <p data-verse="58:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are  like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</p>
            <p data-verse="58:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when  he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> As a snail which melteth, let every one of them  pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that  they may not see the sun.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
            <p data-verse="58:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>
