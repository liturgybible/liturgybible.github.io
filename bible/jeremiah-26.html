            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, came this word from the Lord, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the Lord: Stand in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Juda, out of which they come, to adore in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have commanded thee to to speak unto them: leave not out one word.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil that I think to do unto them for the wickedness of their doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If you will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given to you:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To give ear to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent to you rising up early: and sending, and you have not hearkened:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> I will make this house like Silo: and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when Jeremias made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, and the prophets, and all the people laid hold on him, saying: Let him be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying: This house shall be like Silo; and this city shall be made desolate, without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered together against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the princes of Juda heard these words: and they went up from the king's house into the house of the Lord, and sat in the entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes, and to all the people, saying: The judgement of death is for this man: because he hath prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying: The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house, and concerning this city all the words you have heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Now therefore amend your ways, and your doings, and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will repent of the evil that he hath spoken against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But as for me, behold I am in your hands: do with me what is good and right in your eyes:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But know ye, and understand, that if you put me to death, you will shed innocent blood against your own selves, and against this city, and the inhabitants thereof. For in truth the Lord sent me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then the princes, and all the people said to the priests, and to the prophets: There is no judgement of death for this man: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And some of the ancients of the land rose up: and they spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Micheas of Morasthi was a prophet in the days of Ezechias king of Juda, and he spoke to all the people of Juda, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem shall be a heap of stones: and the mountain of the house the high places of woods.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Did Ezechias king of Juda, and all Juda, condemn him to death? did they not fear the Lord, and beseech the face of the Lord: and the Lord repented of the evil that they had spoken against them? therefore we are doing a great evil against our souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim: and he prophesied against this city, and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremias.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Joakim, and all his men in power, and his princes heard these words: and the king sought to put him to death. And Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And king Joakim sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achobor, and men with him into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they brought Urias out of Egypt: and brought him to king Joakim, and he slew him with the sword: and he cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> So the hand of Ahicam the son of Saphan was with Jeremias, that he should not be delivered into the hands of the people, to put him to death.</p>

            <p data-verse="26:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="26:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</p>
            <p data-verse="26:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</p>
            <p data-verse="26:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</p>
            <p data-verse="26:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</p>
