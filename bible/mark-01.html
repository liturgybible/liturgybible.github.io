            <p data-verse="1:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And forthwith coming up out of he water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
