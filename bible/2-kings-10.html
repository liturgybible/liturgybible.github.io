            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Achab had seventy sons in Samaria: so Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the chief men of the city, and to the ancients, and to them that brought up Achab's children, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> As soon as you receive these letters, ye that have your master's sons, and chariots, and horses, and fenced cities, and armour,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Choose the best, and him that shall please you most of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for the house of your master.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said: Behold two kings could not stand before him, and how shall we be able to resist?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Therefore the overseers of the house, and the rulers of the city, and the ancients, and the tutors sent to Jehu, saying: We are thy servants, whatsoever thou shalt command us we will do, neither will we make us a king: do thou all that pleaseth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he wrote letters the second time to them, saying: If you be mine, and will obey me, take the heads of the sons of your master, and come to me to Jezrahel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy men, were brought up with the chief men of the city.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when the letters came to them, they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezrahel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And a messenger came, and told him, saying: They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said: Lay ye them in two heaps by the entering in of the gate until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And when it was light, he went out, and standing said to all the people: You are just: if I conspired against my master, and slew him, who hath slain all these?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> See therefore now that there hath not fallen to the ground any of the words of the Lord, which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Achab, and the Lord hath done that which he spoke in the hand of his servant Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So Jehu slew all that were left of the house of Achab in Jezrahel, and all his chief men, and his friends, and his priests, till there were no remains left of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he arose, and went to Samaria: and when he was come to the shepherds' cabin in the way,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He met with the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and he said to them: Who are you? And they answered: We are the brethren of Ochozias, and are come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said: Take them alive. And they took them alive, and killed them at the pit by the cabin, two and forty men, and he left not any of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when he was departed thence, he found Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him: Is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart? And Jonadab said: It is. If it be, said he, give me thy hand. He gave him his hand. And he lifted him up to him into the chariot,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said to him: Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. So he made him ride in his chariot,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And brought him into Samaria. And he slew all that were left of Achab in Samaria, to a man, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Elias.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jehu gathered together all the people, and said to them: Achab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him more.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests: let none be wanting, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal: whosoever shall be wanting shall not live. Now Jehu did this craftily, that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he said: Proclaim a festival for Baal. And he called,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And he sent into all the borders of Israel, and all the servants of Baal came: there was not one left that did not come. And they went into the temple of Baal: and the house of Baal was filled, from one end to the other.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said to them that were over the wardrobe: Bring forth garments for all the servants of Baal. And they brought them forth garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jehu and Jonadab the son of Rechab went to the temple of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal: Search, and see that there be not any with you of the servants of the Lord, but that there be the servants of Baal only.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings: but Jehu had prepared him fourscore men without, and said to them: If any of the men escape, whom I have brought into your hands, he that letteth him go shall answer life for life.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass, when the burnt offering was ended, that Jehu commanded his soldiers and captains, saying: Go in, and kill them, let none escape. And the soldiers and captains slew them with the edge of the sword, and cast them out: and they went into the city of the temple of Baal,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And brought the statue out of Baal's temple, and burnt it,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And broke it in pieces. They destroyed also the temple of Baal, and made a jakes in its place unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> So Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> But yet he departed not from the sills of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, nor did he forsake the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the Lord said to Jehu: Because thou hast diligently executed that which was right and pleasing in my eyes, and hast done to the house of Achab according to all that was in my heart: thy children shall sit upon the throne of Israel to the fourth Generation.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord the God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> In those days the Lord began to he weary of Israel: and Hazael ravaged them in all the coasts of Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Galaad, and Gad, and Ruben, and Manasses, from Aroer, which is upon the torrent Amen, and Galaad, and Basan.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> But the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and his strength, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel, in Samaria, was eight and twenty years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.</p>
