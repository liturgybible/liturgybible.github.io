            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Josue the son of Nun sent from Setim two men, to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land and the city of Jericho. n They went and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot named Rahab, and lodged with her.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said : Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will overtake them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently shut.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> The men that were hidden were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up to them, and said:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: Sehon and Og whom you slew.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> We have heard that</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And hearing these things we were affrighted, and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us at your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now therefore swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewn mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father's house: and give me a true token,</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> That you will save my father and mother, my brethren end sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for her house joined close to the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast made us swear:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> If when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren and all thy kindred into thy house.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of this oath which thou hast made us swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done. And sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days till they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the way, they found them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan, they came to Josue the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And said: The Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.</p>

            <p data-verse="2:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</p>
            <p data-verse="2:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="2:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</p>
            <p data-verse="2:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</p>
