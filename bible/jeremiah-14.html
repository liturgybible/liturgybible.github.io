            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Judea hath mourned, and the gates thereof are fallen, and are become obscure on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> The great ones sent their inferiors to the water: they came to draw, they found no water, they carried back their vessels empty: they were confounded and afflicted, and covered their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> For the destruction of the land, because there came no rain upon the earth, the husbandmen were confounded, they covered their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yea, the hind also brought forth in the field, and left it, because there was no grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the wild asses stood upon the rocks, they snuffed up the wind like dragons, their eyes failed, because there was no grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> If our iniquities have testified against us, O Lord, do thou it for thy name's sake, for our rebellions are many, we have sinned against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> O expectation of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble: why wilt thou be a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man turning in to lodge?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why wilt thou be as a wandering man, as a mighty man that cannot save? but thou, O Lord, art among us, and thy name is called upon by us, forsake us not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus saith the Lord to his people, that have loved to move their feet, and have not rested, and have not pleased the Lord: He will now remember their iniquities, and visit their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the Lord said to me: Pray not for this people for their good.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When they fast I will not hear their prayers: and if they offer holocausts and victims, I will not receive them: for I will consume them by the sword, and by famine, and by the pestilence.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, the prophets say to them: You shall not see the sword, and there shall be no famine among you, but he will give you true peace in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord said to me: The prophets prophesy falsely in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor have I spoken to them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination and deceit, and the seduction of their own heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophecy in my name, whom I did not send, that say: Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people to whom they prophecy, shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the fanmine and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them: they and their wives, their sons and their daughters, and I will pour out their wickedness upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And thou shalt speak this word to them: Let my eyes shed down tears night and day, and let them not cease, because the virgin daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction, with an exceeding grievous evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If I go forth into the fields, behold the slain with the sword: and if I enter into the city, behold them that are consumed with famine. The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land which they knew not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, or hath thy soul abhorred Sion? why then hast thou struck us, so that there is no healing for us? we have looked for peace, and there is no good: and for the time of healing, and behold trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquities of our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Give us not to be a reproach, for thy name's sake, and do not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles that can send rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou the Lord our God, whom we have looked for? for thou hast made all these things.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these things.</p>
