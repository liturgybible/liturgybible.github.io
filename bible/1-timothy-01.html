            <p data-verse="1:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.</p>

            <p data-verse="1:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully:</p>
            <p data-verse="1:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man, but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which hath been committed to my trust.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> I give thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in the ministry;</p>
            <p data-verse="1:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the information of them that shall believe in him unto life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p data-verse="1:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> This precept I commend to thee, O son Timothy; according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare,</p>
            <p data-verse="1:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting have made shipwreck concerning the faith.</p>
