            <p data-verse="22:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruits every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And there shall be no curse any more; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him.</p>

            <p data-verse="22:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And night shall be no more: and they shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God shall enlighten them, and they shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="22:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he said to me: These words are most faithful and true. And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to shew his servants the things which must be done shortly.</p>
