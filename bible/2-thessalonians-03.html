            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God may run, and may be glorified, even as among you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men; for all men have not faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But God is faithful, who will strengthen and keep you from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And we have confidence concerning you in the Lord, that the things which we command, you both do, and will do.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord direct your hearts, in the charity of God, and the patience of Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the tradition which they have received of us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For also when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yet do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The salutation of Paul with my own hand; which is the sign in every epistle. So I write.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
