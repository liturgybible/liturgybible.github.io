            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of they father's house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and menservants and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
