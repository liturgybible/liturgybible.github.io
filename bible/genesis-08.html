            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But she, not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And God spoke to Noe, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> All livings things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increased and multiply upon it.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.</p>

            <p data-verse="8:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</p>
            <p data-verse="8:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And God spake unto Noah, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="8:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:</p>
            <p data-verse="8:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>
            <p data-verse="8:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p>
