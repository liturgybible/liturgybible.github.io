            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Cursed is the man that shall not hearken to the words of yethis covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you shall be my people, and I will be your God:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. And I answered and said: Amen, O Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And the Lord said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For protesting I conjured your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt even to this day: rising early I conjured them, and said: Hearken ye to my voice:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear: but walked every one in the perverseness of his own wicked heart: and I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the Lord said to me: A conspiracy is found among the men of Juda, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They are returned to the former iniquities of their fathers, who refused to hear my words: so these likewise have gone after strange gods, to serve them: the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have made void my covenant, which I made with their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Wherefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring in evils upon them, which they shall not be able to escape: and they shall cry to me, and I will not hearken to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the cities of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer sacrifice, and they shall not save them in the time of their affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda: and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem thou hast set up altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore, do not thou pray for this people, and do not take up praise and prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time of their cry to me, in the time of their affliction.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought muck wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair, fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was kindled in it and the branches thereof are burnt.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and the house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me, offering sacrifice to Baalim.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then thou shewedst me their doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim: and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying: Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to thee I have revealed my cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, and thou shalt not die in our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will visit upon them: and their young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And there shall be no remains of them: for I will bring in evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their visitation.</p>

            <p data-verse="11:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</p>
            <p data-verse="11:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant,</p>
            <p data-verse="11:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</p>
            <p data-verse="11:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:</p>
            <p data-verse="11:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</p>
