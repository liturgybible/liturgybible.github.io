            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the Philistines gathering together their troops to battle, assembled at Socho of Juda, and camped between Socho and Azeca in the borders of Dommim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Saul and the children of Israel being gathered together came to the valley of Terebinth, and they set the army in array to fight against the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there went out a man baseborn from the camp of the Philistines named Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and a span:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a buckler of brass covered his shoulders.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his armourbearer went before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And standing he cried out to the bands of Israel, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Philistine said: I have defied the bands of Israel this day: Give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Saul and all the Israelites hearing these words of the Philistine were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Juda before mentioned, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among men.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab the firstborn, and the second Abinadab, and the third Samma.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed Saul,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> David went, and returned from Saul, to feed his father's flock at Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now the Philistine came out morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Isai said to David his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And carry these ten little cheeses to the tribune: and go see thy brethren, if they are well: and learn with whom they are placed.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> But Saul, and they, and all the children of Israel were in the valley of Terebinth fighting against the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> David therefore arose in the morning, and gave the charge of the flock to the keeper: and went away loaded as Isai had commanded him. And he came to the place of Magala, and to the army, which was going out to fight, and shouted for the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For Israel had put themselves in array, and the Philistines who stood against them were prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle and asked if all things went well with his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And as he talked with them, that baseborn man whose name was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same words, and David heard them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the Israelites when they saw the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And some one of Israel said: Have you seen this man that is come up, for he is come up to defy Israel. And the man that shall slay him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father's house free from tribute in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the people answered him the same words saying: These things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Now when Eliab his eldest brother heard this, when he was speaking with others, he was angry with David, and said: Why earnest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And the words which David spoke were heard, and were rehearsed before Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And when he was brought to him, he said to him: Let not any man's heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to withstand this Philistine, nor to fight against him: for thou art but a boy, but he is a warrior from his youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled and killed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the living God?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And the Philistine came on, and drew nigh against David, and his armourbearer before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And he said to David: Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And David said to the Philistine: Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which thou hast defied.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And when the Philistine arose and was coming, and drew nigh to meet David, David made haste, and ran to the fight to meet the Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistine in the forehead: and the stone was fixed in his forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And David prevailed over the Philistine, with a sling and a stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistine. And as David had no sword in his hand,</p>
            <p data-verse="17:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled away.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And the men of Israel and Juda rising up shouted, and pursued after the Philistines till they came to the valley and to the gates of Accaron, and there fell many wounded of the Philistines in the way of Saraim, and as far as Geth, and as far as Accaron.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And the children of Israel returning, after they had pursued the Philistines, fell upon their camp.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And David taking the head of the Philistine brought it to Jerusalem: but his armour he put in his tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> Now at the time that Saul saw David going out against the Philistines, he said to Abner the captain of the army: Of what family is this young man descended, Abner? And Abner said: As thy soul liveth, O king, I know not.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And the king said: Inquire thou, whose son this man is.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And when David was returned, after the Philistine was slain, Abner took him, and brought him in before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And Saul said to him: Young man, of what family art thou? And David said: I am the son of thy servant Isai the Bethlehemite.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="17:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;</p>
            <p data-verse="17:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</p>
            <p data-verse="17:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
            <p data-verse="17:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:57"><span class="verse-num">57</span> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</p>
            <p data-verse="17:58"><span class="verse-num">58</span> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p>
