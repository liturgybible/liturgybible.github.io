And at that time shall thy people be saved, every one that shall be found written in the book.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some unto life everlasting, and others unto reproach, to see it always.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But they that are learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that instruct many to justice, as stars for all eternity.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time appointed: many shall pass over, and knowledge shall be manifold.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And I Daniel looked, and behold as it were two others stood: one on this side upon the bank of the river, and another on that side, on the other bank of the river.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I said to the man that was clothed In linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I heard the man that was clothed in linen, that stood upon the waters of the river: when he had lifted up his right hand, and his left hand to heaven, and had sworn, by him that liveth for ever, that it should be unto a time, and times, and half a time. And when the scattering of the band of the holy people shall be accomplished, all these things shall be finished.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And I heard, and understood not. And I said: O my lord, what shall be after these things?</p>
            <p data-verse="12:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said: Go, Daniel, because the words are shut up, and sealed until the appointed time.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Many shall be chosen, and made white, and shall be tried as fire: and the wicked shall deal wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the learned shall understand.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination unto desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred ninety days,</p>
            <p data-verse="12:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh unto a thousand three hundred thirty-five days.</p>
            <p data-verse="12:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> But go thou thy ways until the time appointed: and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days.</p>

            <p data-verse="12:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>
