            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</p>
