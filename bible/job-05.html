            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Nothing upon earth is done without a voice cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And to the needy there shall he hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in battle, from the hand of the sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Thou shalt he hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> In destruction and famine then shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at pence with thee.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap of wheat is brought in its season.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Behold, this is even so, as we have searched oat: which thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</p>
            <p data-verse="5:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>

            <p data-verse="5:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="5:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</p>
