            <p data-verse="36:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And send thy fear upon all the nations that seek not after thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Lift up thy hand against the strange nations, and let them see thy power.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> As thou wast sanctified in us before them: so be thou magnified among them before us.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And let them know thee, as we have known thee, that there is no God but only thou, O God.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Shew new signs, and make other strange wonders: glorify thy hand and thy right arm, that they may set forth thy wondrous works.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath: take away the adversary, and destroy the enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Sake the time short, remember the covenant, and let them declare thy wonderful works.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire; and let them perish that oppress the people.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, that say, There is none other but we.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Gather all the tribes of Jacob together, and inherit thou them, as from the beginning.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> O Lord, have mercy upon the people that is called by thy name, and upon Israel, whom thou hast named thy firstborn.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> O be merciful unto Jerusalem, thy holy city, the place of thy rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Fill Sion with thine unspeakable oracles, and thy people with thy glory:</p>
            <p data-verse="36:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Give testimony unto those that thou hast possessed from the beginning, and raise up prophets that have been in thy name.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Reward them that wait for thee, and let thy prophets be found faithful.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> O Lord, hear the prayer of thy servants, according to the blessing of Aaron over thy people, that all they which dwell upon the earth may know that thou art the Lord, the eternal God.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> The belly devoureth all meats, yet is one meat better than another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> As the palate tasteth divers kinds of venison: so doth an heart of understanding false speeches.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> A froward heart causeth heaviness: but a man of experience will recompense him.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> A woman will receive every man, yet is one daughter better than another.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance, and a man loveth nothing better.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> If there be kindness, meekness, and comfort, in her tongue, then is not her husband like other men.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He that getteth a wife beginneth a possession, a help like unto himself, and a pillar of rest.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Where no hedge is, there the possession is spoiled: and he that hath no wife will wander up and down mourning.</p>
            <p data-verse="36:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who will trust a thief well appointed, that skippeth from city to city? so who will believe a man that hath no house, and lodgeth wheresoever the night taketh him?</p>
