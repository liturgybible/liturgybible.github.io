            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was of the race of Agag: and he set his throne above all the princes that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all the king's servants, that were at the doors of the palace, bent their knees, and worshipped Aman: for so the emperor had commanded them, only Mardochai did not bend his knee, nor worship him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the king's servants that were chief at the doors of the palace, said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king's commandment?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them; they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did not bend his knee to him, nor worship him, he was exceeding angry.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in the kingdom of Assuerus.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year a of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the king's ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If it please thee, decree that they may he destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents to thy treasurers.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to Aman, the son of Amadathi of the race of Agag, the enemy of the Jews,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it for thyself: and as to the people, do with them as seemeth good to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the king's scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and to the judges of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Were sent by the king's messengers to all provinces, to kill and destroy all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces might know and be ready against that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The couriers that were sent made haste to fulfil the king's commandment. And immediately the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.</p>

            <p data-verse="3:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?</p>
            <p data-verse="3:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.</p>
            <p data-verse="3:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p>
