            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And I beheld, and lo a lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder; and the voice which I heard, was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the ancients; and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand, who were purchased from the earth.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And in their mouth there was found no lie; for they are without spot before the throne of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth, and over every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Saying with a loud voice: Fear the Lord, and give him honour, because the hour of his judgment is come; and adore ye him, that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And another angel followed, saying: That great Babylon is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any man shall adore the beast and his image, and receive his character in his forehead, or in his hand;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels, and in the sight of the Lamb.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever and ever: neither have they rest day nor night, who have adored the beast, and his image, and whoever receiveth the character of his name.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Here is the patience of the saints, who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me: Write: Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow them.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And I saw, and behold a white cloud; and upon the cloud one sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And another angel came out from the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle, and reap, because the hour is come to reap: for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he that sat on the cloud thrust his sickle into the earth, and the earth was reaped.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire; and he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vineyard of the earth; because the grapes thereof are ripe.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth, and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
