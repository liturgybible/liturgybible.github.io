            <p data-verse="107:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>

            <p data-verse="107:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High:</p>

            <p data-verse="107:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were brought low for their injustices.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.</p>

            <p data-verse="107:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up.</p>

            <p data-verse="107:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up.</p>

            <p data-verse="107:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of water into dry ground:</p>
            <p data-verse="107:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He hath turned a wilderness into pools of water, and a dry land into water springs.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded fruit of birth.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop their mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Who is wise, and will keep these things: and will understand the mercies of the Lord?</p>

            <p data-verse="107:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him  families like a flock.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
