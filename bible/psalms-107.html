            <p data-verse="107:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let them say so that have been redeemed by the Lord, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy: and gathered out of the countries.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> From the rising and the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water: they found not the way of a city for their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> They were hungry and thirsty: their soul fainted in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And they cried to the Lord in their tribulation: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he led them into the right way: that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death: bound in want and in iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because they had exasperated the words of God: and provoked the counsel of the most High:</p>
            <p data-verse="107:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And their heart was humbled with labours: they were weakened, and their was none to help them.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he brought them out of darkness, and the shadow of death; and broke their bonds in sunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst the iron bars.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He took them out of the way of their iniquity: for they were brought low for their injustices.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their soul abhorred all manner of meat: and they drew nigh even to the gates of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He sent his word, and healed them: and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him: and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise: and declare his works with joy.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters:</p>
            <p data-verse="107:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> He said the word, and there arose a storm of wind: and the waves thereof were lifted up.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths: their soul pined away with evils.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man; and all their wisdom was swallowed up.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And they cried to the Lord in their affliction: and he brought them out of their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And he turned the storm into a breeze: and its waves were still.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And they rejoiced because they were still: and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And let them exalt him in the church of the people: and praise him in the chair of the ancients.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He hath turned rivers into a wilderness: and the sources of water into dry ground:</p>
            <p data-verse="107:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He hath turned a wilderness into pools of water, and a dry land into water springs.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And hath placed there the hungry; and they made a city for their habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards: and they yielded fruit of birth.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly: and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Then they were brought to be few: and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> Contempt was poured forth upon their princes: and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And he helped the poor out of poverty: and made him families like a flock of sheep.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop their mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Who is wise, and will keep these things: and will understand the mercies of the Lord?</p>
