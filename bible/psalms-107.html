            <p data-verse="107:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,</p>
            <p data-verse="107:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Oh that</p>
            <p data-verse="107:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,</p>
            <p data-verse="107:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
            <p data-verse="107:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and</p>
            <p data-verse="107:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,</p>
            <p data-verse="107:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Oh that</p>
            <p data-verse="107:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,</p>
            <p data-verse="107:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered</p>
            <p data-verse="107:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Oh that</p>
            <p data-verse="107:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> Oh that</p>
            <p data-verse="107:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
            <p data-verse="107:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
            <p data-verse="107:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness,</p>
            <p data-verse="107:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh</p>
            <p data-verse="107:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> The righteous shall see</p>
            <p data-verse="107:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> Whoso</p>
