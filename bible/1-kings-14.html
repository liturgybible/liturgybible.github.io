            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> At that time Abia the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jeroboam said to his wife: Arise, and change thy dress, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Silo, where Ahias the prophet is, who told me, that I should reign over this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Take also with thee ten leaves, and cracknels, and a pot of honey, and go to him: for he will tell thee what shall become of this child.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Jeroboam's wife did as he told her: and rising up went to Silo, and came to the house of Ahias: but he could not see, for his eyes were dim by reason of his age.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the Lord said to Ahias: Behold the wife of Jeroboam cometh in, to consult thee concerning her son that is sick: thus and thus shalt thou speak to her. So when she was coming in, and made as if she were another woman,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Ahias heard the sound of her feet coming in at the door, and said: Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam: why dost thou feign thyself to be another? But I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Go, and tell Jeroboam: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee, and thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and followed me with all his heart, doing that which was well pleasing in my sight:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But hast done evil above all that were before thee, and hast made thee strange gods and molten gods, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut of from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as dung is swept away till all be clean.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Arise thou therefore, and go to thy house: and when thy feet shall be entering into the city, the child shall die,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall be laid in a sepulchre, be- cause in his regard there is found a good word from the Lord the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water: and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke the Lord.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came to Thersa: and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the days that Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Roboam the son of Solomon reigned in Juda: Roboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem the city, which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name wee Naama an Ammonitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Juda did evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him above all that their fathers had done, in their sins which they committed.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For they also built them altars, and statues, and groves upon every high hill and under every green tree:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the people whom the Lord had destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the king's treasures, and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered them into the. hand of the captains of the shieldbearers, and of them that kept watch before the gate of the king's house.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And when the king went into the house of the Lord, they whose office it was to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they brought them back to the armoury of the shieldbearers.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Now the rest of the sets of Roboam, end all that he did, behold they are written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam always.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naama an Ammonitess: and Abiam his son reigned in his stead.</p>

            <p data-verse="14:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,</p>
            <p data-verse="14:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;</p>
            <p data-verse="14:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</p>
            <p data-verse="14:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king’s house.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
            <p data-verse="14:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</p>
            <p data-verse="14:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
