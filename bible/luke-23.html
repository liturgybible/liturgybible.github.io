            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I will chastise him therefore, and release him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> (The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:54"><span class="verse-num">54</span> And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:56"><span class="verse-num">56</span> And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="23:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
            <p data-verse="23:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>
            <p data-verse="23:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
            <p data-verse="23:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
            <p data-verse="23:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</p>
            <p data-verse="23:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="23:53"><span class="verse-num">53</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>

            <p data-verse="23:55"><span class="verse-num">55</span> And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
