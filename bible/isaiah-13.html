            <p data-verse="13:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong ones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as it were of many people, the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To them that come from a country afar off, from the end of heaven: tile Lord and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the whole land.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light.</p>
            <p data-verse="13:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.</p>

            <p data-verse="13:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> It shall no more be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be founded unto generation and generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch his tents there, nor shall shepherds rest there.</p>
