            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> One basket had very good figs, like the figs of the first season: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, because they were bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: Figs, the good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad, which cannot be eaten because they are bad.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="24:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land oif the Chaldeans, for their own good.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: because they shall return to me with their whole heart.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are bad: thus saith the Lord: So will I give Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have remained in this city, and that dwell in the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction, to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a reproach, and a byword, and a proverb, and to be a curse in all places, to which I have cast them out.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land which I gave to them, and their fathers.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</p>
            <p data-verse="24:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</p>

            <p data-verse="24:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.</p>
