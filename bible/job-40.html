            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said :</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Gird up thy loins like a man : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Wilt thou make void my judgment : and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> To him the mountains bring forth grass : there all the beasts of the field shall play.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder : and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> Lay thy hand upon him : remember the battle, and speak no more.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.</p>

            <p data-verse="40:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
            <p data-verse="40:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
            <p data-verse="40:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
            <p data-verse="40:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</p>
