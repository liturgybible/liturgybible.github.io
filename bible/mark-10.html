            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And rising up from thence, he cometh into the coasts of Judea beyond the Jordan: and the multitudes flock to him again. And as he was accustomed, he taught them again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Pharisees coming to him asked him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> But he answering, saith to them: What did Moses command you?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Who said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> To whom Jesus answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you that precept.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And in the house again his disciples asked him concerning the same thing.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he saith to them: Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if the wife shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they brought to him young children, that he might touch them. And the disciples rebuked them that brought them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> Whom when Jesus saw, he was much displeased, and saith to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Amen I say to you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter into it.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And embracing them, and laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he was gone forth into the way, a certain man running up and kneeling before him, asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? None is good but one, that is God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> But he answering, said to him: Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> Who wondered the more, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Jesus looking on them, saith: With men it is impossible; but not with God: for all things are possible with God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> And Peter began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> Jesus answering, said: Amen I say to you, there is no man who hath left house or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> Who shall not receive an hundred times as much, now in this time; houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But many that are first, shall be last: and the last, first.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus went before them, and they were astonished; and following were afraid. And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Saying: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes and ancients, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they shall mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And James and John the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: Master, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> But he said to them: What would you that I should do for you?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> And they said: Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> And Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of: or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> But they said to him: We can. And Jesus saith to them: You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of: and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized, you shall be baptized.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But to sit on my right hand, or on my left, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And the ten hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and John.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> But Jesus calling them, saith to them: You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them: and their princes have power over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But it is not so among you: but whosoever will be greater, shall be your minister.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And whosoever will be first among you, shall be the servant of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho, with his disciples, and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind man, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> Who when he had heard, that it was Jesus of Nazareth, began to cry out, and to say: Jesus son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort: arise, he calleth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> Who casting off his garment leaped up, and came to him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Jesus answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may see.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And Jesus saith to him: Go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he saw, and followed him in the way.</p>

        <div class="translation-text kjv ">
            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</p>

            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:20"><span class="verse-num">20</span> And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:21"><span class="verse-num">21</span> Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:22"><span class="verse-num">22</span> And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:23"><span class="verse-num">23</span> And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:24"><span class="verse-num">24</span> And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</p>
            <p data-verse="10:25"><span class="verse-num">25</span> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:26"><span class="verse-num">26</span> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:27"><span class="verse-num">27</span> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:28"><span class="verse-num">28</span> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:29"><span class="verse-num">29</span> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:30"><span class="verse-num">30</span> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:31"><span class="verse-num">31</span> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:32"><span class="verse-num">32</span> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:33"><span class="verse-num">33</span> Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:34"><span class="verse-num">34</span> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:35"><span class="verse-num">35</span> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:36"><span class="verse-num">36</span> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:37"><span class="verse-num">37</span> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:38"><span class="verse-num">38</span> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:39"><span class="verse-num">39</span> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:40"><span class="verse-num">40</span> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:41"><span class="verse-num">41</span> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:42"><span class="verse-num">42</span> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:43"><span class="verse-num">43</span> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:44"><span class="verse-num">44</span> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:45"><span class="verse-num">45</span> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:46"><span class="verse-num">46</span> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:47"><span class="verse-num">47</span> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:48"><span class="verse-num">48</span> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:49"><span class="verse-num">49</span> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:50"><span class="verse-num">50</span> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:51"><span class="verse-num">51</span> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:52"><span class="verse-num">52</span> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</p>
