            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither all Israel were assembled, to make him king.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And when Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, (for he was fled thither from Solomon,) heard it, forthwith he returned.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they sent for him, and he came with all Israel, and they spoke to Roboam, saying:</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy father oppressed us with a most grievous yoke, do thou govern us with a lighter hand than thy father, who laid upon us a heavy servitude, and ease some thing of the burden, that we may serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said to them: Come to me again after three days. And when the people were gone,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before his father Solomon, while he yet lived, saying: What counsel give you to me, that I may answer the people?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they said to him: If thou please this people, and soothe them with kind words, they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, end began to treat with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his train.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said to them: What seemeth good to you? or what shall I answer this people, who have said to me: Ease the yoke which thy father laid upon us?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> But they answered as young men, and brought up with him in pleasures, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to thee: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it: thus shalt thou answer them: My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more weight to it: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So Jeroboam, and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as he commanded them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the king answered roughly, leaving the counsel of the ancients.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And he spoke according to the advice of the young men : My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> And he condescended not to the people's requests: for it was the will of God, that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And all the people upon the king's speaking roughly, said thus unto him: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai. Return to thy dwellings, O Israel, and do thou, O David, feed thy own house. And Israel went away to their dwellings.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But Roboam reigned over the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Juda.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes, and the children of Israel stoned him, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to gee up into his chariot, and fled into Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Israel revolted from the house of David unto this day.</p>

            <p data-verse="10:1"><span class="verse-num">1</span> And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:2"><span class="verse-num">2</span> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:3"><span class="verse-num">3</span> And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:4"><span class="verse-num">4</span> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:5"><span class="verse-num">5</span> And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:6"><span class="verse-num">6</span> And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:7"><span class="verse-num">7</span> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:8"><span class="verse-num">8</span> But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:9"><span class="verse-num">9</span> And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?</p>
            <p data-verse="10:10"><span class="verse-num">10</span> And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:11"><span class="verse-num">11</span> For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:12"><span class="verse-num">12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:13"><span class="verse-num">13</span> And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</p>
            <p data-verse="10:14"><span class="verse-num">14</span> And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:15"><span class="verse-num">15</span> So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:16"><span class="verse-num">16</span> And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:17"><span class="verse-num">17</span> But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:18"><span class="verse-num">18</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p data-verse="10:19"><span class="verse-num">19</span> And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>
